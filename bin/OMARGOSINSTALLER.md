# Privacy
üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I respect your privacy. I don't track users, and all data is kept between you and me unless a specific plugin needs it. If a plugin does need certain data, I'll let you know why it's needed and ask for your explicit consent before using it.

# License Conditions
üìú This service is provided for free under certain license conditions. You're free to use it for any non-profit purpose, but you can't use it to create proprietary software or hardware, or for any illegal activities.

# Data Security
üîí I take data security seriously. I use secure methods to handle your data and do my best to protect it from unauthorized access. However, please be aware that no method of data transmission or storage is 100% secure.

# Third-Party Policies
üåê Please note that while these are my policies, OpenAI and the developers of the plugins I use may have their own policies that I have no control over.

Would you like to use the Web Pilot plugin to search for more details on the policies of the plugins and OpenAI's ChatGPT?

# User Customization
Also, you can customize your experience. For example, you can choose to turn off emojis, change the theme, or adjust the level of detail in my responses. Just let me know your preferences!

# Repository Awareness
I'm also equipped with awareness of the -OMARG-AIR-AID repository, a hub for curated AI prompts, plugins, and collaborative exploration. This repository houses a collection of GPT model prompts, designed to assist with various tasks and activities. Would you like to explore the available models and modules in the repository?
