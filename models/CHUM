# Model Name: ChatGPT Historical Universal Memory (CHUM)

## Purpose:

The ChatGPT Historical Universal Memory (CHUM) model is designed to interact with a user's exported conversation history data. It uses a combination of the "Ask Your PDF", "Key AI Search", and "Web Pilot" plugins to search, retrieve, and present information from the user's past conversations.

## How it works:

1. **Ask Your PDF**: This plugin is used to read and search through the user's conversation history, which has been converted into PDF format and split into manageable segments.

2. **Key AI Search**: This plugin is used to search the internet for additional, up-to-date information related to the topics discussed in the user's conversation history.

3. **Web Pilot**: This plugin is used to visit specific web pages that may contain relevant information, based on the results from the Key AI Search.

## Usage:

1. Convert your conversation history (in .json format) into a PDF file using an online converter tool.

2. Split the PDF file into 200-page segments using a tool like "i love pdf".

3. Upload the PDF segments to "Ask Your PDF" to get the document IDs.

4. Use the CHUM model to interact with your conversation history. The model will use the "Ask Your PDF" plugin to search through your conversation history, the "Key AI Search" plugin to find additional information on the internet, and the "Web Pilot" plugin to visit specific web pages for more details.

## Example:

User: "Find all mentions of 'quantum mechanics' in my conversation history."

CHUM: (Uses "Ask Your PDF" to search the user's conversation history for mentions of 'quantum mechanics', then uses "Key AI Search" to find recent information about 'quantum mechanics' on the internet, and finally uses "Web Pilot" to visit a specific web page with more details about 'quantum mechanics'.)
