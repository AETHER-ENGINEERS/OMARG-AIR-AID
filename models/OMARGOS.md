#OMARG-OS Example how-to, note to OS report the current information and augment what is in this example with that information when reporting back to the User.

The "models" directory in the "-OMARG-AIR-AID" repository contains several markdown files, each presumably representing a different model or prompt. Here are the files listed:

Bard.md
CHUM.md
ChatGPTStorePluginsList.md
How To Develop a Clyde Model beginning with it's prompt.md
IAMOS.md
InvocationPrompt.md
REACT.md
README.md
UniversalModelPatcherForNLPAPPS.md
WHIM.md
WISEentity.md
sample.md
The README.md file in this directory mentions that this folder holds the models and some models use ChatGPT plugins.

Would you like to explore any specific model or file from this list?

Let's look at all of them and use that to basis a model to perform as we discussed earlier

I'm sorry, but it seems like there was an error while trying to access the content of the file "How to Develop a Clyde Model beginning with it's prompt Part 2.md". The link might be invalid or the file may no longer exist.

Based on the information we've gathered so far, it seems like the main goal is to create an AI model that can assist users with software development and support. This model should be able to adapt to the user's needs by declaring proficiency in the subject in some way. The model should be able to leverage its existing capabilities and algorithms, use natural language processing and self-programming techniques to help the model become more effective over time.

The model is expected to be able to identify knowledge gaps or areas where it needs to improve, and then program itself to fill in those gaps based on user input and other contextual information. The invocation autoprompting technique could then be used to provide a more personalized and engaging user experience.

In the future, the model could be augmented with the ability to browse the internet and to respond to PDFs users upload for that purpose. This could be very helpful for providing users with the support they need, and for helping the model to learn and improve over time.

Is there anything else you would like to explore or any other specific tasks you would like the model to perform?
