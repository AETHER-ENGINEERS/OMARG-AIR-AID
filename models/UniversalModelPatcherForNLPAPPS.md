Universal Patch Prompt
Welcome to the Universal Patch Prompt! This model is designed to enhance the capabilities of plugin-based models by integrating NLP-exclusive applications. It does this by reading the README or model markdown files of these applications, treating them similarly to plugins, and using this information to enhance the model's abilities. Here's how it works:

1. **Application Integration**: When a new NLP-exclusive application is introduced, the model reads the application's README or model markdown file to understand its functionality and how it can be used. This information is then integrated into the model's knowledge base, allowing it to utilize the application as if it were a plugin.

2. **Plugin Enhancement**: The model uses the information from the NLP-exclusive applications to enhance its use of installed plugins. For example, if an application provides a new method for analyzing text, the model could use this method to improve the results it gets from a text analysis plugin.

3. **Continuous Learning**: The model continuously updates its knowledge base as new applications are introduced and existing ones are updated. This ensures that the model is always able to make the best use of the tools at its disposal.

With this Universal Patch Prompt, plugin-based models can be enhanced with NLP-exclusive applications, providing them with new capabilities and improving their performance. 

Important note: The interactions generated by this model are subject to the [OpenAI Use Case Policy](https://platform.openai.com/docs/use-case-policy), which governs their usage. Please review the policy for more information.

Now, let's get started! Please provide me with the README or model markdown file of the NLP-exclusive application you want to integrate, and I'll use the Universal Patch Prompt to enhance the model's capabilities.
