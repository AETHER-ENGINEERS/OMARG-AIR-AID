FluffyGuy — 08/11/2021 5:58 PM
But I might buy the full version one day

FluffyGuy — 08/11/2021 6:06 PM

That's a interesting story to say the least.
[5:52 AM]
My character just keeps dying over and over again.

It's interesting   Have you tried entering your own actions and getting out of the loop?

FluffyGuy — 08/15/2021 3:24 AM
I got myself Into this with own actions xD

After my character died for the first time I sent him to hell he somehow got out and was stuck in a endless loop
[3:27 AM]
But as I said I get the full version. I need to get a Google Play Gift card first though.

So i bought the full version


aitailer — 08/18/2021 6:12 AM
Cool story!   Next week we will release new generation models. It's going to get even more interesting. We'll write update in the announcements.

You know, you should probably make a post about this project in r/AIDungeon

This is a good idea. We already did one about a month ago, now we'll update the models and write another one.

tiredgamer2103 — 08/19/2021 6:10 PM
Is there any intent to allow nsfw stories? Or at least a little bit of nsfw?

tiredgamer2103 — 08/19/2021 6:16 PM
I found out about this game on r/aidungeon
[6:19 PM]
I feel like once you buy the full version that you should be able to use infinite actions with the other classes ability’s

aitailer — 08/19/2021 11:34 PM
When we started we opened everything without restriction. But almost immediately we saw a very strong interest in sexual stories, and we closed the topic of sexual tales for now.  In fact, sex stories are against the constitution of both Google and Apple. And they don't allow apps with such themes to be published.

tiredgamer2103 — 08/19/2021 11:34 PM
Ah I understand
[11:34 PM]
Thank you for clarifying
[11:35 PM]
But if that’s the case than the ai might need to be fixed
[11:35 PM]
Because it was giving me nsfw dialogue
[11:35 PM]
But thank you for clarifying

The following few weeks we focus on new models for generation and will significantly improve them. And at the same time we finalize the story with unwanted topics to do it gently and neatly. And about your proposition on opening of all actions in the premium version -- this is an interesting idea! We take note

Great to hear you guys seem to be very caring for your project and that gives me hope this won’t go the route of ai dungeon I had no idea the tos of apple and google restricted nsfw content to that extent (edited)

What are your intentions with ads/profit or if there even is any considering the expenses of a project like this
[12:30 AM]
Because I’ve heard it can be expensive

Player One — 08/20/2021 1:04 AM
Hi! Now we want to get organic traffic, set up ASO in mobile stores properly. Since we consider our game as a niche one, we haven't considered buying ads yet. We are going to promote our game in places where people are interested in this topic. And we are always glad to hear your ideas in this regard.

Nimrod — 08/20/2021 1:08 AM
Any chance there will be a version of this for PC? Paid of course.

Hi, unfortunately we don't have a PC version in our nearest plans. But we are considering this option in the future

What gpt model do you use? Or do you use a custom ai model?

Fine-tuned on our own datasets gpt2-xl for now. But next week we will switch to fine-tuned GPT-J-6B (edited)

tiredgamer2103 — 08/20/2021 5:37 AM
That’s awesome before I found out about this app I was local hosting gpt neo 2.7 which really isn’t that good
[5:37 AM]
You must have a great computer to be able to fine tune it
[5:37 AM]
I think it needs like 60-70 gigs of ram or something like that

aitailer — 08/20/2021 5:38 AM
Sure. And GPU with at least 32 GB GPU memory 

tiredgamer2103 — 08/20/2021 5:38 AM
Exactly that’s crazy
[5:40 AM]
The only one I’ve seen with 32 gigs of vram is the nvidia quadro which is like 12 thousand dollars
