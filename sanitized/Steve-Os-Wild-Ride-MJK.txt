thank you hey everybody and welcome to a poetic
0:06
wild ride with Stevo we've got Maynard's James Keenan of tool A Perfect Circle
0:12
Puscifer and I have to say I've been a fan of this guy for considerably more
0:18
than half of my life I've always known him to be so mysterious uh such an
0:23
enigma Larger than Life like just a rock star he would say just a poet but man I
0:30
don't think we've ever seen me uh do a podcast with somebody I was such a fan of which makes for just an incredibly
0:37
entertaining experience which includes the most embarrassing moment I think I've ever experienced on the podcast and
0:46
uh if you're not going to want to miss it it's pure gold um also I want you to know that tomorrow
0:53
as this comes out on Friday March 31st Puscifer is releasing
1:00
existential Reckoning rewired which is a track by track reimagining of
1:07
existential Reckoning their last album that is available Friday March 31st be
1:13
sure to get it and scrap on your seat belts for this one let's get into it
1:19
okay so we won't waste any time check check recording every camera recording
1:25
of the camera oh it's you're blowing your shot with that blind not being down
1:32
yeah that's not the blindness you're doing great
1:38
there you go yeah now you're not so shooting into the light
1:44
all right ladies and gentlemen Maynard James
1:50
Keenan where [Laughter] yeah dude uh you've met Scott Randolph
1:57
this is Vinnie what's up dude sir nice to meet you and uh we're here in Arizona
2:03
thank you so much for inviting us out here man what an honor it's an honor to have you here watching
2:10
people storm your overly branded bus yeah it's not so subtle my tour bus is
2:17
obnoxiously wrapped with my face and name and I haven't uh I have regretted
2:22
that at times um never regret yeah you guys sit there
2:28
just dripping with anxiety to to look at the rap on oh yeah I was like to drive
2:34
around with my name on a bus I would just be folding in on myself you guys don't put tool on the side of
2:40
yours intro was there ever
2:46
ever no no Puscifer nope nothing no I think at some point we did maybe Perfect
2:52
Circle and it was like never again like that was
2:57
1999 or 2002 or something like what a dumb idea
3:03
I am don't expect to wrap any buses again in the future for what it's worth
3:10
um yeah I was dying to ask about that if there was ever a tour bus we had we had um Paul Frank wrapped uh
3:18
uh Perfect Circle bus at some point that was kind of cool okay how many tour buses are you guys taking out with tool
3:25
when you guys are going around [ __ ] uh I would be guessing uh 10 7 8 wow you
3:34
guys each get one yeah we finally got to that age where it's like I'm kind of I don't I kind of
3:40
like you but not that often I don't want to breathe in your farts at night no yeah no
3:47
um yeah but you know then I go right back on the road with Puscifer and it's 20 people 20 person bus we're all just crammed on
3:54
top of each other wow see you know it's good to to know what it's like
4:02
I I could have guessed that you wouldn't have been big on wrapping buses because you're notoriously private and um and
4:11
here I am on camera being private I know that's it that's the thing is um As I
4:16
understood it you know in the early days of tool like you guys basically
4:22
at all cost avoided being on camera like avoided doing interviews like didn't
4:28
like you were pretty unseen and uh you've opened up over the years like is is there a philosophy to being
4:37
less private well I mean I just yeah there's many layers to that uh
4:46
friends get together we write some songs I write some poems and sing to them it's not that special it's not on a wire
4:54
tripping over yourself to come taste my skin you know it just seems weird to
5:00
have that kind of a you know that reaction over some [ __ ] poems this seems weird right uh so it's out of
5:06
balance for what seems normal all right but also just like your private life should be
5:12
you know kind of your private life right but then you know flipping that around like
5:18
trying to don't don't photograph me um then you just have to start listening
5:23
to what you said yourself and go am I so important right not really that important
5:29
but at the same time you like your privacy so sure when you're when you're serving food yeah uh
5:37
people are there to have the food but when you're not serving food I shouldn't be bugged about recipes right and that
5:43
that makes sense um with that with the writing the poems
5:51
it it's crazy to me that that you seem
5:57
to strive to not really play a role in making the music you want the music done
6:02
and then well depends on the project right yeah so you know historically I wrote a lot earlier with tool we all
6:10
wrote together I would bring a piece everybody brings something to it uh same thing with Puscifer with Billy he wrote
6:16
a bunch of stuff he just had a bunch of stuff written so that was kind of the process that we just kind of went with with perfect circle well with the
6:23
Puscifer there's a lot more collaboration going on between Matt and Karina and I uh tool like I said early
6:28
days we were all writing but as you get older stubborn more successful and the
6:34
ego start to swell and all four of us can't fit our heads in one room you know one of us has to back out and just let
6:40
that fight occur and then wait for the chips to fall and then go okay
6:45
I'll write some poems to that yeah so you get the music and then you and
6:52
notoriously the music can take a long time to get to you and uh and then when it does get to you
7:00
you turn around because you're trying to react to the music yeah yeah and generally that's
7:07
that's how I write I've been recently I've been working in in logic finally unlocked
7:13
the logic Magic Door where I can come up with rhythms and Melodies that are just kind of you know sketches on a napkin
7:20
and I'm able to write a lot more music in that way because I'm not a drummer
7:25
I'm not a guitar player I can play guitar I can barely tune a guitar and that's how I used to write it as on a bass
7:32
um but I just kind of like because there's better bass players because there's better guitar players that's just going to let them do that but now
7:39
that I've unlocked just little uh tool no pun intended and logic I'm
7:44
like I have this new thing now where um I can't have I can't finish my coffee
7:49
unless I write at least a beat or a melody in logic and then send that off to Matt
7:56
and Karina and Puscifer go here here's my here's my morning coffee so like at least three a week
8:02
I send them something so I'd like this folder of like 40 things I've been working on over time
8:08
and I'm sending some of those to if it sounds like it's leaning toward Perfect Circle it's leaning toward tool I'll
8:13
send them those away but usually you just get crickets back from those guys so like that's a cute riff
8:20
stay in your [ __ ] Lane nice um with with uh
8:27
you know the Puscifer just the name of the band and V is for a vagina like
8:32
there there's so much what are you implying well I'm I'm uh
8:38
I'm observing uh the naughtiness and there's been like Tool's been naughty
8:43
like from the get-go and there's been issues with uh with with like censorship
8:49
and stuff yeah how much of uh like how much of it is like oh let's you
8:54
know like what I'm trying to think of my question here like I'm emotionally 11. I
9:02
like that I I like that and I relate to that like how much did it screw you over with success oh right I mean you guys
9:10
almost tried to not be successful it seems like oh man Puscifer we've shipped the first record V is for vagina shipped
9:16
we were doing great it all went out from the time that we started recording V is
9:21
for vagina until the day that we actually released it the record industry [ __ ] collapsed so all the record
9:28
scores were open when we started recording when we released Tower and virgin had all closed like all those Mom
9:35
and Pops had closed we were stuck with Target Best Buy uh Kmart and Target sent
9:42
our albums back because it said vagina on it yeah I was like what we pissed you
9:50
you don't like vagina yeah I love them I know it's kind of like us with the hot sauce like Amazon's like dude you guys
9:56
are doing great we want to put you on the front page our hot sauce is called hot sauce for your butthole
10:01
and they're like can you change the word butthole it seems like no [ __ ] way you figure out a way to not have a
10:07
butthole we'll change the name then we could talk yeah right so I mean
10:13
there's kind of a parallel there but when you guys I mean you guys relied on that income for with Walmart and Target
10:19
and all those places right yeah and then all of a sudden you're like [ __ ] what do I do yeah I mean because that implicit
10:24
was an independent man so like I wrote the check for all those all that vinyl yeah not only pay for the vinyl to be
10:30
made but to have the vinyl shipped back to me and then ran a [ __ ] Warehouse
10:36
to put it in and we still we sold it all eventually but like that was scary like
10:42
to have you know 80 000 pieces of vinyl shipped back to you what year was it
10:49
vinyl with that I love that you said piece of vinyl yeah it's a real uh what
10:54
year was that was that before all the success no that was that was a poster for that was uh
11:01
2007 2006. no yes 2007 when not when everything kind of fell apart [ __ ] yeah
11:09
so what do you do how did you get rid of all those records you know we just kept touring and kept making records and
11:14
doing [ __ ] and they finally sold we just got I just recently this last year we got a whole new run of you know color
11:21
variants on it those are still moving so it took it's just I don't know I'm [ __ ] stubborn so don't take no for an
11:28
answer and yeah just keep going what is your opinion
11:34
of record labels like in general like no pressure well no
11:41
I mean I've never sold music so so I you know I'm pretty ignorant but I've always
11:48
understood that in order to make it big you need the record label
11:56
this is this is all in this is very individual based this is all very
12:02
specific to an individual artist most artists are some uh woe is me somebody
12:08
touched my butthole gonna bring it back to your house uh
12:13
when I was kids now I gotta be up in front of people acting like a [ __ ] um no idea how to do business no idea
12:20
how to organize anything but you're incredible at whatever this art is that you've developed over the years dancing
12:26
around in front of a mirror with your [ __ ] brush right um so that you need somebody
12:32
like a manager or a label to kind of handle all that business side of things
12:37
in theory but if you have a head for that you really don't need a label you just don't if you understand how to
12:44
run a business but now we're back to like most artists right no clue
12:50
they can barely get up before 11. right there's just not it's just not in their nature right
12:56
um I come from a farming Community back in Michigan you know I'm a martial artist so there's
13:02
there's things you got to do during the day to get to prepare for that okay just have a big breakfast and go run on the
13:08
mat and start doing Jiu Jitsu right so I'm up at 5 30. just because that's just
13:13
my nature um I have I plan um so I don't know I think labels aren't
13:20
neces what it comes down to is um individual
13:26
jobs within promoting an album that I might not be able to handle like actual
13:31
marketing and actual like distribution mailing lists and all that kind of [ __ ] that like there's there's various
13:38
there's various ad agencies and and promotional institutions and marketing people that have that covered and then
13:45
there's the logistics of you know warehousing and shipping and dates and deadlines and stuff that I have a head
13:52
for but I delegate that to my wife because she's really good at it
13:58
um so we kind of you know kind of manage it that way so if you can do that do that yeah and do you want to be as big
14:04
as you know whatever the biggest star is nowadays well then you're going you have to be part of the system 100 if you're
14:11
going to be Beyonce you you have to be tapped in because everybody wants their fingers in that pie and that way
14:17
it gets big because the bigger the pie the bigger your slice right right so there's that but at the level of
14:24
puscifer's operating at you know we're playing to like two thousand three thousand people it's it's a decent number of people to
14:31
play to but it's still you still have to manage those margins right and try to talk to them try to
14:38
talk to some dude and some rock man that you know about the word margins see how that goes
14:43
right Scott's my guy yeah for for all of that
14:48
um how long have you been married uh 10 years wow I should get married on
14:54
leap year day so two and a half years okay three one one three
15:01
that's is that right because that's my that's my sober birthday uh on leap year we got I think I thought
15:08
it was a leap year that year but we actually got it was on 29th of February
15:13
12. yeah okay yes I thought I thought I got sober on a leap year and so then
15:19
like four years later I was like dude I got someone to leap year like that wasn't a leap year that year I always thought I was right leap year
15:25
baby so you're bad at math yeah and you're in charge of yeah
15:32
for sure six other for sure
15:38

15:44

16:09
for my fiance but for my next tour I'm putting together this really wild show called uh Steve has gone too far to her
16:16
and uh there I'm gonna think of the implants I'm not thinking of it I'm
16:22
gonna absolutely do it okay I don't want to show you my Amazon cart
16:28
right now but like I literally was buying you know all everything going on I was like I gotta bring back the tits
16:35
nice because I used to wear them in 97 and I ordered them and I got this it's
16:40
like weird like it's a whole sleeve like you have to put it on like a vest and it's tits like these are these feel like
16:47
this is like stripper tits they're like yeah they're silicone but they're like right here so put it on and my wife's
16:54

17:08
go go seek up you think yeah it'll look better yeah it seems look a lot better dude I mean dude
17:14
there's just something about d and or double dude might as well go double yeah that's that's good I probably shouldn't
17:21
talk about that in front of your wife right that you even know what a d-cup looks like right that's true let's just
17:28
edit this part out I am that's what my girl is is not super
17:34
thrilled about about that whole plan but I'm only gonna have them for like three months okay and that's just for the the
17:40
production period of the show logistic Minds I'm kind of going okay give
17:46
yourself time to do the thing heal from the thing get healthy from the thing and
17:51
then go do the tour well right I'm not touring with the tits I'm just doing like but I do a multimedia tour so so
17:58
there's everything gets shot the show gets put together and then the tour goes
18:03
on okay as a multimedia thing okay I feel like you got to do at least one meet and greet with the tits though I'm
18:09
gonna do lot of things with the tits bro okay so that's not what this is about I'm just I'm just riffing here if you
18:17
have the teeth on the super low cut right just a not just barely nipple right just
18:23
a little bit of areola but make sure there's a camera see how many guys so that you're watching dudes like coming to shake your
18:29
hand and they're like the eye contact issue I got a whole white board
18:35
[Laughter] what can I say man I got plans I got a
18:42
lot of plans and you gotta have plans especially when it comes to your health
18:47
your diet is the most important thing man that is why I go with athletic
18:53

convenient travel packs of the ag1 I speak of with your first purchase again
19:52
that is at athleticgreens.com Stevo jump on it you'd be a fool not to
19:58
now let's get back to it yeah eye contact yeah like a screensaver yeah
20:08
there's there's a lot um did did you know that that uh your music
20:16
was in Super Rad skate videos yeah we were aware of that like yeah loved it
20:23
I think mostly illegally yeah but uh most of course yeah yeah big brother got
20:29
away with murder in that regard right there was a union Wheels video and um
20:34
both Tom Boyle and Chris Markovich had Tunes of yours and uh
20:41
you have an address for them
20:50
um particularly loved that now um so we're in Arizona where this is
20:58
where you do your wine thing like talk to me about doomsday prepping
21:04
yeah yeah I love that is that why you guys like bromptons because they're like easy to pack does it have anything to do
21:12
with speaking of packing uh it is Arizona uh
21:17
you know I think you know part of my doomsday mindset is just
21:25
understanding water and farming right because I think
21:31
part of it is there's going to be there's going to be climate changes there's going to be weird things that happen and if you
21:37
understand the movement of the sun and the stars and seasons in your area
21:45
it really is about for the reset right understanding how to
21:51
get Beyond those things and survive Preppers I think if they're really
21:59
you know smart Preppers they're thinking about the first 72 hours
22:06
of when [ __ ] really goes down and just maintaining sanity for those that period
22:11
of time and then maybe having a [ __ ] some kind of store of water or food or something for a while but when it comes
22:17
to like actual doomsday like radiation and nuclear weapons like there's no amount
22:23
of preparing that can help you with that that's [ __ ] absurd like yeah there's nothing you're going to do to to outrun
22:30
something that's that massive of a scale but you know if you I think it's part of
22:37
like okay so I was telling you we just we just moved our Jiu-Jitsu Academy over um to another location
22:43
better location more square footage like more students coming in it's going to be it's great but part of the idea of of
22:50
self-defense training is that now I can I can kick somebody's ass and
22:56
if you've never wrestled or done boxing or Muay Thai or Judo before ever in your
23:03
life the idea that you're going to stop somebody who has a little bit of that background that's bigger or stronger or
23:08
faster than you that's kind of dumb but what I have noticed is that people you know short of gunshot wounds
23:16
if you come in and you're training enough you're actually putting yourself in a in a stressful situation
23:22
and you've if you've never had somebody to lay on top of it you were saying like that was that was something that was big
23:28
for you like having they just saw that stuff that Suffocation feeling if you become
23:33
accustomed to that feeling and you're able to work through the stress of that feeling of somebody
23:40
on you pressuring you will against will and you're able to relax through that
23:46
I think when it comes to things like end of the world scenarios just remaining calm and clear
23:54
knowing how to secure fresh water knowing how to like
23:59
you know where to look for food or how to grow food when it's all said and done that amount of
24:07
not peace of mind I guess it's kind of peace of mind but that being able to relax through it and accept accept the
24:13
fate and just go this is what we're gonna do um we just found that people are get in weird situations that have done enough
24:19
martial arts in their life they don't they go they don't go completely to that Red Zone where they black out and tunnel
24:25
vision and then their limbs go numb as much as somebody who's never done a martial art or ever had somebody laying
24:32
on top of them or attacking them trying to you know strangle them or whatever so this it is kind of a you're relieving
24:39
the initial stress and the adrenaline dump right yeah first first amount of
24:44
tricks you guys used to do with jackass I guarantee like the first a bunch of those you did There's you go man that
24:52
was you I don't remember because you went right into that weird adrenaline dump thing initially I feel
24:58
like this thing on stage open for Steve I will black out and I won't remember what the [ __ ] because it's a weird
25:04
adrenaline dump and you get tunnel vision and you know cottonmouth and all those things but as you've done it a couple times even though there's a thing
25:11
you've never done before and you're worried about doing it it's not nearly as daunting as the first time
25:17
you did it before the cameras were ever even rolling right and there's also
25:23
a lot more of the anxiety like leading up to it is scarier than the thing itself right and once you've been
25:30
through that a couple times you go oh right remind yourself of that and you're
25:35
fine breathe through it that's one of the things we always when people are you're new here you haven't done any of
25:40
these things that's what I was telling I did that whole seminar just explain the movements before the movements there's
25:46
an introduction to jiu jitsu yeah I can show you all these things I can show you the guard and show you all these things but if you don't even understand how to
25:52
move your body to begin with to defend yourself to get out of this thing right right
25:59
survive Escape control submit you can't submit if you have no control
26:05
over the situation and you have and you don't have an exit strategy to just survive right right you said that you're
26:13
making a documentary about that yeah we filmed we filmed the seminar itself I'm
26:19
editing it together with these guys and uh um I'm gonna probably go back and film
26:25
some more to really detail it but just the understanding their body movements and things you're going to end up
26:31
encountering in a new Jiu Jitsu Academy if you don't even understand how to move your body and control your own weight on
26:38
the ground now you have somebody on top of you if you have any kind of childhood trauma
26:43
you're like you don't want to be here you're out I used to be put on their mattresses when I was a kid so it just
26:49
stirs that up oh yeah yeah I will bite and [ __ ] [ __ ] myself I'll do anything
26:55
to get out of that situation like no [ __ ] questions asked yeah like I
27:01
don't give a [ __ ] if my mom died on I'd buy her fingers off you know fighting
27:06
doesn't work you're shooting yourself
27:11
right I'm just down to go to that like like I remember when I was driving to a
27:18
party one time they put me in the back of a car bite and then like [ __ ] stuff yeah got it well dude people kept piling
27:26
in and then and then so like I was in the back of the car and somebody's like hey everybody look Scott's about to freak out and then that just freaking me
27:33
out and I just started punching my way out the side window I believe that that's called triggered yeah I read it
27:40
online triggered yes so hey look everybody's got this [ __ ] has passed
27:47

29:02
why you got to get over to hellotushy.com Devo now now let's get back to it all right
29:11
oh my God you did that to yourself yes but you know going back to the Doomsday
29:16
prepping I feel like there's there's this looming thing that people I'm gonna
29:21
be the the one who survives but it's like there's so there's so many infinite
29:27
variables about what that even means right you're better off tuning yourself to understanding farming
29:33
growing your own food finding fresh water like those kind of basic things
29:38
that you would have to do I remember watching um The Walking Dead series and I'm watching
29:44
it just going this is cool I think the drama you know whatever you know there's oh look there's a zombie uh but then all
29:50
of a sudden I was like I haven't where are they getting their water right right and then like the next
29:57
episode was them like literally trying to find water so whatever the writer did like they
30:03
were you know it's like they put that in there like literally part of their entire survival was like trying to find
30:09
water for an entire episode which is probably going on across the whole story everywhere with
30:14
people realizing that but because there's things you just don't even write okay your car broke down on the side of
30:19
the road is it going to be cold tonight is it going to be hot tonight do you have water do you have any food like just all those
30:26
things that go through your head in the middle of Australia when your bus breaks down right right um well what do you think is going to
30:32
happen and what do you think is going to happen for like Doomsday I mean I think that you've got like economic collapse
30:39
is right at the top of the list um
30:47
that seems increasingly right increasingly likely may you live
30:53
in interesting times [ __ ] you give me the boring yeah right Water Crisis yeah
31:01
Waters definitely water wars is a big big one um
31:07
climate in general uh what are the other Mega threats
31:12
um another uh Tick Tock another pandemic is uh likely
31:27
as far as interrupting uh just basic Utility Systems
31:33
if if somehow the AI decides to make a decision that is global in terms of like
31:38
right the delivery of electric or gas or whatever let's add cyber War to the you
31:46
know cyber warfare I think is is a legit one there was a book
31:51
um written by Neil Strauss called uh like emergency this book could save your
31:57
life and and for writing the book Neil Strauss uh became like like he hung out
32:04
with militia people and like all these different like scenarios uh got like a
32:10
pilot's license I think and you know how to get a citizenship in other countries
32:15
and like it was pretty fascinating that um you know the learning how to ride a
32:21
motorcycle because when uh the [ __ ] hits the fan everybody's
32:26
trying to get out you've got all the traffic but the motorcycles can split Lanes yeah it makes a lot of sense
32:31
unless you live in some place that's like a small town of 500 people right you're already out of that awful
32:37
situation right yeah that's why I moved here just because I mainly because I didn't
32:44
resonate with a large city it just didn't I'm from a small town so I moved back out here because I have
32:50
access to a large city to do the work I can do with with the band but like I moved out here to get away from sure
32:56
just that just that energy that was I don't I wasn't raised with that energy so you know I have
33:02
like wine I have Farms we have Gardens and greenhouses and I raise ducks and quail and
33:07
you know that's just that's just who I am um so if you understand how to keep
33:13
Quail alive and keep ducks or chickens alive got food right you raise Quail for the
33:19
eggs yeah we have these in the meat uh no the meat uh I have a hard time with
33:25
that I can't I can't kill the Ducks we tried that like I was like okay raise these ducks uh from babies and you know
33:33
it came time to like okay these ones have to go and like I had nightmares for a week
33:39
so we have a bunch of these ducks that don't lay eggs that are just like freeloaders they don't pay any rent
33:45
are you completely off the grid pretty much no no no no no and I think that
33:51
again going back to the purpose thing that is an absolute absurd myth that you're going to be able to live off the
33:56
grid for any length of time if there's going to be some kind of materials that you need to trade for you can't grow
34:03
your entire thing by yourself generally speaking you have to be a master at that stuff in the right location to deal with
34:10
the the seasonal changes and all that you're going to end up having to trade something with somebody for some kind of
34:16
thing to get a job done there's that dog food or resources or tools or whatever
34:22
yes you're gonna you're gonna you know fuel even if that might be at
34:27
that point where like there is no there are you know you have to figure out how to do that well that's where there's that's where distillation comes in you
34:34
know you're you know figuring out how to like create a fuel A flammable material
34:39
from using wood to distill some kind of sugar-based so are you reading books on
34:45
this [ __ ] like at night before it's just logic it's just simple logic of like looking at what you do in your life or
34:51
you're going to just eat the raw food because somebody gonna need heat or you need to like cook your food
34:57
okay well then you're going to need some kind of a fuel source to cook your food okay well then what you know what kind
35:03
of you know it's just all those things unravel just logically and logistically in my head to go okay well
35:10
uh move to a small town learned how to grow food and feed ducks and uh quail
35:16
and how about bunkers are you under those I have a well you just saw one of them like that's that thing is
35:22
temperature because their bunker for me is is a place where we can regulate temperature okay if I have to live in
35:29
that thing in the middle of summer in the middle of winter it's going to maintain a certain temperature so it's a
35:34
comfortable living setting I thought bunker had to be underground that's what I thought well the lower
35:41
part of that okay there's a roof that's easily three feet thick and it's surrounded on three sides by ground so
35:48
you roll those doors down and that is technically it's a bunker it's not it's
35:54
not buried underground like you have to go through a tunnel to get to it that's I can't even imagine the psychological
35:59
mess you would be living in one of those for about a month I don't disagree that
36:04
it might be unpleasant to spend that much time in a bunker but I really like
36:10
the idea of having a bunker and the only problem is how are you going to pay for it and I have your answer you start
36:18
killing it in the e-commerce game that's how you become prepared for disasters by
36:26
making money and how do you do that well you start off by having something to
36:31
sell like Stevo's hot sauce for your butthole or the excruciatingly hot
36:36
stevos butthole Destroyer now I sell this stuff on Amazon I sell it at

38:11
how I ship every order with ship station I love them you need to use them shipstation.com promo code Stevo let's
38:19
get back to it yeah so that was strategically built to where like it picks up wind and the it just picks it
38:27
just makes sure that the if the power grid goes out for a period of time because I'm
38:33
assuming that we're all going to try to get back on the same page to fix whatever breaks right right so that
38:39
bunker is meant to be that way so that it has thermal mass and therefore my wines being stored in there don't go bad
38:46
even though the power is off for a week two weeks it's meant it's meant to
38:52
house them in that way so they're they're preserved you sell the wine in
38:57
Whole Foods no I think Whole Foods picked up some of our stuff at some point but I don't really make enough wine to really be in
39:04
those larger larger chains we make we might quit a bit but Whole Foods tends to be like we want to make sure that you
39:10
have a [ __ ] load of wine and we always want to be able to get it and there's you know there's consistency
39:17
with that so you end up with much much larger larger uh things see I'm here uh
39:24
a boutique wine label kind of yeah we do we're we're at about 15 000 cases
39:30
split between four eight Wine Works uh caduceus and merkin
39:36
um which is pretty small compared to most California wineries how does Arizona
39:41
uh compare it to California California is like a wine country right yeah the so
39:48
the the best way to describe what's going on in Arizona were high this is this is geeky stuff now so you're going
39:53
to lose your audience but I'm going to say it anyway because you asked me Argentina you're familiar with Mendoza
39:59
and you have all the model books that come from that area that elevation and that that Latitude is is similar to
40:07
where we are so as far as high you'll get snow in the winter and it's high it's higher altitude
40:13
um temperatures and everything are very similar so if you've ever had an Argentinian Malbec I can now you know that we can grow wine
40:19
here okay because you know that that that's possible and then the lava soil yeah we have we have volcanic soil here
40:25
we have a lot of um Limestone as well because you should be completely under underwater here
40:32
ocean uh but as far as what we end up producing out here that
40:37
ends up being strong it's very Mediterranean so Italian Spanish wines really really grow well here
40:45
California uh they have kind of the more Bordeaux and burgundy kind of French
40:51
soils and climates that kind of back that up we're more like Italy Spain
40:57
southern France Portugal that's our strength what elevation is
41:02
this here we are at I'm gonna get it wrong because uh Jerome we're uh 4 900
41:08
feet down in Cornville or like 3 000 3200 feet so I'm gonna say I think here we're about 4 100 feet
41:16
and that's important when you're farming elevation oh yeah certain crop cacao grows like seven to nine thousand
41:23
feet yeah Coffee Bean grows at like two to four thousand feet that's all fascinating very specific yeah so then
41:31
is because of our so but that there's there's yes and no on that
41:38
so if I'm at if I'm at 4 000 feet here
41:45
I'm technically compared to California we're farther south we're closer to the Equator
41:51
so you go oh it's going to be too hot to grow grapes you've been in Phoenix you don't bother trying to grow grapes there
41:58
but Phoenix is a lower elevation so the closer you get the Equator the higher in
42:03
elevation you have to go so now you get the cooler temperatures because you're higher up okay so depending on the
42:08
depending on the coffee beans it all it's yes it's elevation but it's also latitude where are you
42:14
can you grow hydroponic grapes that's a big facility
42:19
yeah it would be a large facility I'm sure they have but that's that's cost prohibitive with energy we're just
42:27
having to build a huge building to put your grapes in it that's that's a lot of infrastructure is it the Dank huh yeah
42:40
[Laughter] um
42:46
the wine is is a crazy world evidently um so with uh
42:53
yoga like every day you start with a physical exercise it's kind of yeah yeah
42:59
I mean just a walk around the vineyard to begin with just you you watched walking up this hill was just like it
43:06
doesn't matter how many times I walk up that hill it's like it's you know being on a StairMaster
43:11
for the first uh as in your waking moments it's right it wins you uh but
43:17
you know you know we do the Jiu Jitsu Academy I'm blending Jiu Jitsu with
43:23
actual physical you know warm-ups and conditioning
43:28
Lauren Landau uh Aaron one of his main guys there out of Denver uh Landau
43:36
performance has all these great programs for strength and conditioning that are non-invasive you know not injury prone
43:43
it's not like no CrossFit if you're trying to do CrossFit to do like a professional sport you're an idiot
43:49
because you're going to get injured now you can't do your professional sport right okay so the more strength and
43:55
conditioning stuff that Lauren's doing is you're getting as in in shape but you're not risking injury doing it make
44:03
sense I'm throwing big ass weights around and trying to right like running is generally not really good for you not
44:10
great it's not great but like Versa climbers everyone on one of those Versa climbers oh my God the things that thing
44:17
should be buried in hell yeah great they
44:22
have those in Brompton version where you they Fold It Fold It Up do they put it in here
44:28
the the Versa climber is like this mean-spirited medieval [ __ ] torture device that I I love it well how long
44:36
has this like uh regimented been like have you been doing this for I mean I go
44:41
in phases you know you go on the road and you try to maintain that and then just the hours of you know you're you're
44:47
on stage at nine or eight o'clock and you're not getting off until 11 and you
44:53
haven't eaten because I can't eat after five because I have to go on stage right so then now now you're eating it
44:59
like right midnight which is the dumbest time to eat and then you gotta go to bed and a bouncing thing down the highway so
45:06
your my workout schedule on the road just goes to [ __ ] because there's you can't figure out how to get that now
45:11
you're trying to recover by sleeping till noon yeah do you like the tour bus life no
45:18
do you get to a place do you stay in a hotel or you stay in the bus uh it's all about this it's all about
45:25
the timing it's all about sleep like hitting the REM state yeah if I'm at REM State like if it's
45:32
like 5 a.m and the bus can stay where it's at I don't have to get out of it
45:37
I'll stay in the bus to sleep just so I can get through that that stage then get up around like eight or
45:44
nine and get in the hotel room and and then but if you go back to bed then now you're [ __ ] because you're gonna
45:49
sleep till two and mm-hmm do you have a method of calculating your REM sleep
45:54
no how do you know dreams uh you know when they say hey man you want to go in
46:01
the hotel I'm like you [ __ ] like you're like ripped out of the cool hot air balloon you were floating around the
46:07
Amazon River you dick that was it was a great train okay um
46:12
no I think I think it's just I can track it more when I'm home
46:18
and I know where that state is because I hit it and then when I wake up refreshed
46:23
but in the bus it's like trying to hit that state it's it's hard because
46:28
sometimes it's a long drive and right when you would be in that state you're
46:33
you know you're going through Ohio and hitting every pothole that was everything yeah
46:39
I have saw a tool concert I've seen a couple
46:45
but the 1996 in Albuquerque New Mexico Albuquerque
46:51
and no I was living there I was so just I mean not not to crawl up your ass
46:59
and and you know smother it with kisses but I think I think you're looking you meant to say butthole yeah yeah all
47:06
right bring it back I mean there was um like uh just like the the notes man like
47:13
the the like the recreate like there's certain bands like just aren't great
47:18
live and and uh I've found tool to be unbelievably Stellar live okay and uh I
47:28
mean I just wanted to throw that out there that was great
47:34
what's your point Steve he did great just let it let it go okay
47:40
now I felt my face turning red hot like how has um performed like like
47:48
it's been so many years now like uh well yeah you know old cars right they
47:54
used to like you know an old uh Barracuda man just like tearing up the streets you tried to do that with an
48:00
old Barracuda now and it's that's gonna break something's right you know it just you just can't do that so
48:07
think with age you find you find ways to sing the thing where it's not
48:13
creating damage you can actually recreate it without having to
48:19
pick a scab emotionally and literally like hurting yourself so I think my
48:24
writing has changed over the years um and I can do some of those songs I can't
48:30
do a whole set of those songs right I can pepper them in so I can still do some of those things but I can't you
48:37
can't if you're actually sitting down and thinking about it you can you know you can't expect
48:42
some of those dudes that you know back in the day to do the thing they did when they were 30 years ago 40 years ago that
48:49
you can't expect that out of that body your body doesn't do those things forever you see the latest uh
48:55
latest it was like a year ago Mike Tyson fighting yeah who do you fight Roy Jones
49:01
yeah so as much of a monster as that dude is and I have all there's respect
49:07
and rule for Tyson watching him do that it's like please please don't do this ever again yeah because you can see the
49:15
age there's a there's a there's an absolute expiration date on on that high performance and then at the level that
49:22
that guy was operating at when he was in his prime and to watch whatever that was right if you don't get it by seeing that
49:30
that's the and I'm using him as an example like that glaring example of like that is an absolute expiration date
49:36
your net your your body is not going to allow you to perform the way you used to perform at certain ages so
49:44
you can apply that to pretty much everybody when it comes to physical sure
49:49
that's why jackass is gonna be so funny when they're 70. it's going to be like the broken hip episode just break in
49:56
half um just talking about the stunts and they break a hip going to get some get a [ __ ] yogurt for sure right uh
50:03
we I have found my bones to be a considerably more brittle yeah um at this time and I had the same reaction to
50:11
the Mike Tyson fight and and I love Mike um I was actually at his uh like the
50:18
little compound where where he does his podcast the the Tyson ranch with a bunch
50:24
of friends and stuff and I I felt the same way that you just described but also it was like a
50:32
phenomenally successful event like yes it wasn't so there's there's and and
50:38
that always ends up being the factor um money it's just
50:44
it twists [ __ ] and you know if many people that probably have their hand out
50:50
to make money on that fight for Tyson I'm sure they have their handout again trying to talk him into doing another one right when you as a viewer you
50:58
remembers you see Anderson Silva connect dude the other night uh San Hagen and
51:05
Cheeto those guys those guys are lightning fast with those strikes right
51:11
and to watch Mike Tyson knowing how fast he was and then see yeah you can
51:18
perceive the micro second delay that he has to deal with now I said in the intro
51:25
that I had the most embarrassing moment on the podcast ever and I think we can
51:30
agree but Man Maynard was cool to save the day by just talking about how we
51:38
lose our virility as we get older and you know it's true and that's why I love
51:46
Bluetooth because I'm getting older man it's harder for me to perform all right now even if you're a young buck turns
51:54
out blue cheese actually just a lot of fun no matter where you're at in your life it's more fun when you're rocking
52:02
Bluetooth why because Bluetooth are chewable tablets with the same active ingredients as Viagra and Cialis it's
52:11
one ingredient active and man when it activates it is party time and blue shoe
52:17
only costs a fraction of the price of Viagra and Cialis if you go to
52:23
bluetooth.com and use the promo code Stevo you can get an entire month's
52:28
supply of Bluetooth tablets absolutely for free all you gotta pay is five bucks
52:34
for shipping and they make getting the prescription super easy because you just do it with the online medical provider
52:41
at bluetooth.com if you're getting older or if you're not it's more fun with
52:47
Bluetooth take my word for it and go to bluetooth.com use the promo code Stevo
52:53
to get an entire month's supply of Bluetooth tablets totally for free all
52:58
you pay is five bucks for shipping that's bluetooth.com promo code Stevo
53:03
now let's ride this baby out compared to that you know compared to what he was especially when you watch
53:11
you know Cheeto and sandhagen fight or even Chuck the delphot again you know yeah that is that that's just that was a
53:18
tough one yeah yeah but but but the the money and
53:23
and the greed ends up being the factor that ends up uh taking a toll on people I mean the older
53:29
you get like this this last Australian tour like really [ __ ] damaged me like
53:35
being back home you know like what are you guys laughing at these guys I mean out of the country
53:41
there's a story I'm kind of I'm gonna talk to him later
53:46
he was able to get into the country but like yeah
53:52
the 30 the you know the the 20-something shows in 30 days and like uh I mean we
53:57
toured for the last 10 years but like that like it I can't catch up on sleep
54:03
all those different like something's off this net these like last five days and I
54:09
gotta go back in like three or four days that way it's the easy way it doesn't matter if the travel the travel part is
54:15
going to be the part that just gets you that's that's why if I can opt to go from stage into a bed
54:24
right these guys go off stage into a [ __ ] Netflix marathon and stay up to
54:29
like three or four but I'm like dude I have to [ __ ] sleep or I'm dead yeah by the way thank you for saving me from
54:36
that moment where no no we're gonna we're gonna Circle back oh yeah we're coming back
54:44
so enough about my hair what do you think about me
54:50
um and and thank you for for mentioning uh UFC God do I [ __ ] love it yeah I
54:56
uh I love it so much and um the Cheetos sandhagen fight it was tough to watch
55:03
Judo not get started on that fight like yeah and you know so that
55:10
yeah we can go on for hours on on that just that idea of of the armchair jackasses chanting
55:18
stupid [ __ ] in the audience having no [ __ ] idea everything that went into that fight you have no idea Shiro could
55:25
have had the shits that day sure and he has to deal with that going in so that that's that
55:30
oh a second of timing off for sure for that night that he has to deal with that thing and nobody knows about it
55:36
he jammed a finger opening a drawer four hours before you don't know like what's
55:42
going on so on that day right San Hagen had the upper hand that's it next time
55:47
they meet maybe a completely different story it might be the opposite because those are both guys operating at the highest level
55:55
of the sure thing the guy teaching at our uh our Academy Clay is our black
56:01
belt on site um he fought MMA and he ended up breaking his he ended up breaking his
56:07
back during training at some point out in Denver his last fight he lost a decision
56:14
to sanhagen who then got picked up after that like a fight later he got picked up
56:19
by the UFC and hearing him tell stories of like just what you think what you
56:24
think you know about what's happening in that ring is absolutely beyond your comprehension in terms of
56:30
just the level that they're operating at right and Sam Hagan particularly with this switching stances constantly and
56:36
coming from every footwork is like Dominic Cruz and sanhagen have should be
56:43
like you know writing code to upload to us later you watch every UFC I don't
56:49
watch all of them I definitely have my favorite Fighters that I pay attention to I was extremely extremely extremely
56:56
happy for Holly Holm yeah that was like that that was like so
57:01
yeah worried about that one and I to see her just
57:06
who the [ __ ] are you damn yeah she was great who do you have Stipe or Jon Jones
57:13
uh July 8th oh [ __ ] really I mean I don't
57:18
know maybe you just made that yeah I don't I don't I don't know because uh we didn't really get a chance to see a lot
57:24
from Jon Jones then although he was training that exact uh strangle so it could have been a
57:33
setup and again that day yeah the dude across from him didn't he
57:39
had he had a just a micro second bad day that's it right and that changes the entire fight
57:45
um so I mean I wouldn't mind seeing them fight again right and I was always been a fan of Jon
57:51
Jones I think he's he's his worst enemy yeah so we spoke with Alexander volkanovsky when
57:59
we were in Australia just a couple days after the Jon Jones fight and in the UFC
58:05
rankings Volk lost his number one pound per pound to Jon Jones and I submitted
58:13
that we didn't get to see enough out of Jon Jones to uh to Warrant that but then
58:20
I doubled back and said you know but the fact that he made it that easy is
58:25
there's a lot to be said for that too so maybe maybe I can't take that from him yeah because you know other other than
58:31
Jones's own demons and him [ __ ] himself up over the years
58:36
dude he's one of the best yeah I mean I think the consensus would be that now
58:42
that he's the heavyweight champion that is the best all right I think that's the consensus
58:50
um I love the that uh yeah have you ever been tempted to tweet to get your Tweet
58:55
on the screen you know I thought about it and I was like here's what's gonna happen I'm gonna be
59:01
like let me see if they're gonna oh my [ __ ] God I misspelled that [ __ ]
59:07
yeah I'll do something stupid for sure like I'll put the wrong Fighter's name up oh my God I did I did one of those
59:15
they're pretty good about about not putting it up if you make a mistake right what did I say uh
59:22
I I got some like uh yeah I always get it wrong I'm way too uh
59:28
I'm the guy though that like my friends are all like there's no way that guy can lose or that's no way that girl can lose there's
59:34
no way they're like they're the best in the world and I go look they've won 10 in a row Amanda Nunez
59:43
100 odds are odds are against you even if you're the best in the world there's
59:49
like this weird thing like you're not allowed to right as good as you are you're not you're not allowed to win
59:55
like 13 in a row or 12 in a row like there's a number in there that's like no you don't get to win that one
1:00:01
you will immediately come back and [ __ ] mangle the person in the next fight yeah because you are that good but
1:00:09
for some way the universe just it won't let you have that thing and so there's so many times that my my buddy just met
1:00:14
him Tim with the flip-flops up there he's like no there's no way there's no way that that person is gonna there's no
1:00:19
way the chef shanko's gonna lose like don't say that I was a lot more surprised by shevchenko getting caught
1:00:27
by a Grasso than I was uh Nunez getting caught by Giuliana Pena right because
1:00:33
the next fight right Rosso is gonna go what happened right because chefchenko's
1:00:40
no joke she's going to make the adjustment and she's going to fix it right and unless Grosso keeps up with that adjustment
1:00:46
it's not gonna happen I think Nunes has a way of uh getting in her own head like
1:00:52
I think Nunez kind of lost to herself yes and shevchenko the less inclined to
1:00:58
do that I feel like right so much more surprising yeah um I uh I watched the uh
1:01:06
volkanovsky Islam fight at Dana White's house and I asked him two questions I
1:01:12
said what do you think about if uh in the inspection Zone when you know they're getting their cup checked and
1:01:17
stuff if they were standing on a scale so that the viewer could know how much
1:01:23
weight they put on since the official weigh-in because I'd be interested by that right and he said that they had
1:01:28
tried that a couple times and that he didn't like it because uh it drew attention to weight cutting which they
1:01:34
don't really care to do right I said okay fair enough how about this his weight cutting is all full it's gnarly
1:01:40
it's awful yeah it's really gnarly um I said how about this you know there's been not much of a debate over
1:01:47
open scoring because nobody's interested in it like um but what do you think about at the beginning of round two
1:01:54
round three you know if there's Championship rounds like at the beginning of those rounds show what the live odds are and how the odds have
1:02:01
changed with each round and and Dana like pulls his phone sends a voice
1:02:07
message to somebody hey Stevo wants live odds I guess check it out and like literally from that moment for the rest
1:02:12
of that night every every fight began with the live box and Dana said you're
1:02:18
not wrong Steve I I like this he's like Stevo's odds because I was gonna say they just started doing that is that you
1:02:24
yeah that was me congratulations I like this adjustment because I was like is
1:02:29
that because I'm I'm watching I see what I see and this this number now matches what I
1:02:35
see right they're they're they're not doing it regularly you know it's not
1:02:41
something that now is in place and I think they're doing it more I would love it if they did it all the time as a rule
1:02:47
but I understand why maybe they wouldn't want to do that because it indicates more of a blowout
1:02:54
fight making it you know the the illusion of uh but it was during the the chefchenko
1:03:01
grazo fight I texted Dana uh live odds please and we got him right away right
1:03:06
and I thought Grosso was looking really good in that first round but going into round two the the the Gap had swollen
1:03:15
and it said uh chefchenko was minus one thousand uh yeah and I remember seeing
1:03:20
that going that's not what I just said that was not what I saw either I was surprised and that that minus 1000
1:03:27
chefchenko live odds made Grasso finishing her that round so much more uh
1:03:34
satisfying and yeah like uh maybe just so much more unlikely and and
1:03:39
awesome that's sick yeah we could talk about fighting on the hours all night I
1:03:45
love it we should steer the focus over to Vinnie for a little while now oh God I I do feel that I owe it to you to tell
1:03:51
you about Vinnie's prison pocket well we have a couple different ideas
1:04:02
we have a spiritual story or a prison Pocket story let's take a pic I have a
1:04:08
feeling this somehow intersect sort of
1:04:15
Vinnie recently became our our co-host and his grade he's colorful he he uh and
1:04:22
and he just had this experience a guy came up to him in public yeah he died to
1:04:28
tell the story I was at the gym working out and uh after working out I went to go to this restaurant in the same
1:04:34
parking lot and I finished eating I get back in my car and I see this Indian dude maybe late
1:04:39
40s early 50s walk by my car turns his head locked and he just locks eyes with me
1:04:44
stops him in his track and just go excuse me sir you have a very lucky and happy face and at first I thought this
1:04:51
dude was like a kook you know just like absolutely crazy and he comes over to my car he's like no we're supposed to meet
1:04:57
here at this very moment and I'm like okay this dude is definitely a cook first
1:05:04
and then he grabs my wrist right and he and as soon as he grabs my wrist I get
1:05:09
this like intense feeling of like pins and needles you described it as heroin but I described it as a magnified heroin
1:05:16
High just times a thousand and um and he starts missing a liver
1:05:24
and uh and he's like he kept saying we're supposed to meet here at this at this moment and he takes out this piece
1:05:30
of paper out of his pocket and he's like put this hold this tight in your right hand and don't let go okay like I'm
1:05:38
really in this now you know and uh he's like he's like you were uh you were meant to be on this Earth your purpose
1:05:44
is making people laugh and making people happy and um he's like what I want you to do is tell me a relation a female
1:05:51
relationship in your life that's been bringing negative energy and the first thing that came in my my mind was my mom
1:05:56
so I just said my mom's name and then he's like names her maiden name and what's the last four of you
1:06:02
yeah and then and then he goes like he's like name the first kind of flower that comes to your head so I say lilies he
1:06:09
goes what uh what year did your mother birth I said 87. he goes what do you want to do and what are you doing now
1:06:15
he's like I would like to do some TV stuff and uh then he just goes on saying like
1:06:20
again we were here to we were we were meant to meet here you uh you are on the right path like everything you're doing
1:06:26
is the right thing keep doing what you're what you're doing you need to stop thinking so much you need to stop planning so much I just do and he goes
1:06:32
touch that piece of paper to your forehead and open it up I touch that [ __ ] to my forehead and open it up it has my mom's name 1987 lilies and TV see
1:06:42
that's where the story throws me off because like that's part of like Hokey magic tricks you know like and then she
1:06:50
had the paper in his head yeah you have that experience and for you to poo poo whatever that is whatever magic
1:06:58
came next for him sure based on that experience right if this guy stole his
1:07:04
car and it's his identity yeah now we got a problem but whatever that is and I
1:07:09
have I have friends that you know that believe in ghosts they believe in those things they believe in Tarot Card those things I [ __ ] love the stories of
1:07:16
that if that inspires you to be kinder or better or more constructive with your
1:07:22
life with somebody else's life 100 in but if you ask me honestly that
1:07:29
[ __ ] had your number
1:07:39
I'm kind of in the same corner too but it's like yeah you can Google my birth my birthday like you could find that
1:07:45
[ __ ] out but how how's this dude gonna know that I'm gonna say lilies right and that's where the camera recording of the
1:07:52
bill from the building that's not a bad idea okay and the more compelling part of the story I think
1:07:57
superheroes are real a dude that's really fast wrote ran around the building wrote it on the piece of paper
1:08:03
and put it in his hand and you couldn't see him he was so fast yeah I I find the
1:08:08
most compelling piece of the story the physical Sensation that came over your body when he touched it yeah and and
1:08:13
then an uncontrollable sobbing like I couldn't stop crying and I it was almost
1:08:19
like my heart was skipping beats and I couldn't move and then after he after he
1:08:24
just says he leaves I'm sobbing uncontrollably and then I turn around and he's just gone
1:08:29
and it was I so many emotions were going through my head like I'm [ __ ] terrified that was I'm kind of stoked I
1:08:36
was sick I don't know what to do I'm texting him I'm like dude I'm freaking out like like people call them worried
1:08:41
about them yeah after he left those people in on it no no [ __ ] way
1:08:47
and you you're an immediate response was I think I might have just had a conversation with god that's why I
1:08:54
texted him that was the first thing I can't take that away from you yeah yeah and and so uh State he says where
1:09:02
was this uh in Ella okay yeah what would Michael Jordan be doing in La yeah
1:09:10
and the next day the one thing that he's been dreaming of the most
1:09:15
all right I'm Dreaming but working hard he wanted to be verified on Instagram so
1:09:23
bad for the next day yeah yeah congratulations
1:09:32
Australian Visa came through despite the fact that he is a intent to sell drug
1:09:38
dealer in your pocket heroin addict congratulations on all of those things
1:09:43
you used to live in a porta potty yeah yeah so he went to prison for six
1:09:49
months he knew he was going what a Segway nice so you talked to Michael Jordan in L.A
1:09:56
but I went to prison yeah before that and and then going knowing that he was
1:10:01
checking himself in for six months in jail are you cool about talking about yeah yeah this is fine
1:10:10
[Music] mellow he knew he was gonna be dope sick
1:10:16
so he went for the prison pocket and what did you fit in there uh a
1:10:22
hypodermic needle 10 Xanax bars a thing of Rolling Papers maybe two grams of tobacco and enough
1:10:30
dope to last me a couple weeks I still got five more fingers yeah I would I wouldn't put this that's it I
1:10:38
would have been advantages yes some Brazilian coffee beans
1:10:48
yeah but um Vinnie's past and and now Vinny's
1:10:54
recently celebrated five years of sobriety killing it doing like from where he was
1:11:01
he's on the right path doing the right thing and this this magical Michael Jordan character told him don't think so
1:11:08
much don't plan so much everything's gonna work out in the in the months of April May and July April May July you're
1:11:14
gonna your life is gonna change radically for the better yeah and I'm rooting for you dude well thanks dude I
1:11:20
love it I want it all to be true yeah me too yeah and the fact that you got to tell that story but if it's not true if
1:11:27
it doesn't go the way that that was described take that as a challenge to
1:11:33
make it go that way for sure and the way that I think of it it's just more of like as long as I just continue like being
1:11:39
the best version of myself every day things work out without any explanation I don't know how it's just that's how
1:11:45
it's been happening the last couple years and every year it's just been better and better so that's just what I'm gonna do you are a
1:11:52
special person
1:11:58
Vinnie's Vinnie's a Manifesto and he's a very special person yeah I believe having a manifestation yeah yeah and
1:12:06
I've always found 35. yeah you're there you're lucky that yeah you figured out
1:12:11
how to make those things happen when does it start happening for you uh
1:12:18
right around 28 I started realizing that there's ways
1:12:24
that I could not you know not manipulate time and space it's not like that it's just more more paying attention to
1:12:30
decisions that I already made and building on what recognizing that
1:12:36
decision process and recognizing that feeling in your gut combined with the experiences that you have logged up in
1:12:43
your computer like combining experience with intuition to make decisions but
1:12:49
also going I can't make the wrong decision right there's it's going to lead to some
1:12:55
uh educational conflict or some success that I can then build on for more
1:13:02
more good or bad decisions they're just decisions and you go forward yeah do you have a book that changed your life
1:13:10
um besides doomsday prepping but like not doomsday prepping uh yeah I wrote a lot
1:13:17
of I read a lot of uh Joseph Campbell back in college and things like that uh
1:13:23
but honestly it was just just experiences watching paying
1:13:30
attention to not just my own experience but my other other friends experiences and just seeing what they went through
1:13:36
for decisions that they made and letting go of things that didn't matter I think
1:13:43
that's the that's the biggest man it just if you can get to the point where you
1:13:49
can understand what to let go of like imagine how fun the internet would be
1:13:54
if people knew how to just let go of [ __ ] and not engage and just fight to the
1:14:01
death over the dumbest [ __ ] hilarious [ __ ] ever
1:14:07
yeah yeah it's just and it's all about that it's all that age of like no I have to win this fight with a stranger yeah
1:14:14
on the opposite side of the globe over [ __ ] pizza recipes or whatever and on
1:14:20
the flip side of that if you can let go of uh you know for me the over developed
1:14:26
concern for the opinions of others if I didn't you know right if I wasn't
1:14:31
so gripped by fear of what you know people think of me or they're so hurt by
1:14:37
a negative comment right oh yeah that's but you're but you're you're exposed like I am in that way like you you take
1:14:44
that seriously because you are an introspective person and you care you're a caring person so you're gonna
1:14:49
you're gonna take some of that on just that's just your nature uh but being able to take a deep breath in those
1:14:55
moments and let that [ __ ] go yeah it's [ __ ] hard but it's essential
1:15:01
yeah that easy and for where you you were saying
1:15:08
um my experience has been that when I get so stressed out I'm trying to force something to happen and it's like ah
1:15:14
like uh if I can just turn my attention and my energy to the the work
1:15:22
of recovery everything else sorts itself out yeah 100 like oh yeah like you know
1:15:30
am I am I doing the work of recovery if I do that then I don't have to worry about anything I was reading a book last
1:15:36
night you squared it talked about a fly just kept hitting the window and hitting the window he just kept hitting the
1:15:42
window and then he just finally just that he'll do that until he dies and all he has to do is just turn around and go
1:15:47
the other way and he can go right into the door easily and the wind will take him so it's like don't force anything
1:15:53
you know yeah that that was a really interesting and the wind will take him
1:15:58
that's the craziest part wow um my uh meditation app every once in a
1:16:04
while it says uh um by uh struggling to paddle like well
1:16:11
inevitably drown but if we just relax we float
1:16:19
yeah like a high fiber turd yeah like a high five return
1:16:26
um that is true but you know circling it back around to the UFC and doing martial
1:16:32
arts and everything that's some of the guys as you watch those dudes get higher up in Jiu Jitsu they're so relaxed yeah
1:16:39
because they understand that the more this young dude who's just stressing out trying to win
1:16:46
30 seconds this guy's going to be so gassed because he's just he's wasting all of his energy rather than just like
1:16:52
relaxing into the moment to go if I put my hand here where does this extremely
1:16:58
experienced black belt put his hand where's he move his foot where does he shift his weight
1:17:05
based on me doing a thing to see what he's doing rather than me like I learned
1:17:11
a dance move on YouTube and I'm going to try to force the dance move right you're just wasting your time you got to pay
1:17:17
attention to what this guy who has experience is going to do in reaction to you reaching with his hand or reaching
1:17:23
with his hand or whatever and that relaxing that's the wind understanding that yeah other than beating up against
1:17:29
the glass that's you got to just get a good bend with band with the wind I mean you had to get really good at that being
1:17:34
a farmer like oh you have no idea zero zero all the plans in the world and
1:17:41
then you get hail your [ __ ] crops toast mm-hmm so you just have to you have to go this is what I've got this is
1:17:48
what I got this year this is what we're doing and when you plant the seed hurry up and grow what the [ __ ] are you doing nothing
1:17:53
gonna happen you just gotta forget about it there's a there's there's I cannot make the grapes be ripe in you know
1:18:00
April they're going to be ripe in August September there's nothing you can do to
1:18:07
force that issue so that patience and let go let God kind of thing that's
1:18:14
farming man it's to a T um how much uh why is it that wine they
1:18:22
say like age like a fine wine is that real like wine gets better the older it is uh yeah that's old yeah you don't
1:18:29
have enough Italians okay yeah yeah well it's it's it's about the the the
1:18:35
complexity that is that living breathing creature in a bottle it changes over time and the more uh TLC that went into
1:18:43
the actual growing of those grapes and then the ushering and Those Grapes into that state of being a wine
1:18:49
they have a they have a structure that is built to age and change and become
1:18:56
more complex with age there's definitely a peek to it then it falls off but like there is there is a
1:19:02
an understanding of wine making and grape growing that kind of goes into that statement that gets lost with just
1:19:08
the Aging lack of Fine Wine well if you want if you want to understand all the effort to took into cultivating that
1:19:13
vine and all the effort that it takes to coax that fruit off that vine in the
1:19:19
most the best expression of that day that year and then put it in that bottle that getting in the way and not manipulating
1:19:25
it you know that's where I'm going to come from it from that metaphorical you know steward
1:19:32
I'm not a I'm not a winemaker I'm a steward of the grape just getting it from grape to to wine
1:19:38
all right um uh Puscifer
1:19:44
like is is it an imminent release or it already uh the so every time we do a full-length
1:19:52
album we then go back and we reach out to all of our friends and they have a reimagining of all the tracks and so
1:19:59
that's being released uh March 31st is Friday this Friday from the day after
1:20:05
this comes out perfect yeah so that'll be out in the market uh you know all the all the formats final CD remember
1:20:12
compact discs and um
1:20:17
streaming digital all that it's pretty fun like we got a lot of cool people to kind of do it this time uh it's always
1:20:24
nice to hear what people are gonna reimagine these things so quite a few uh
1:20:30
Justin uh Chancellor from Tool did one uh Ocarina in the band my favorite was
1:20:36
Karina's track um but Trent uh and Atticus did one
1:20:42
uh Sarah Jones drummer for uh Harry Styles okay Sarah did one
1:20:48
um she was actually on the she played a lot on the actual album our album uh we were trying to get her to go on tour
1:20:54
with us but she's out with Harry like she's like permanent fixture in that whole thing so we kind of lost her
1:21:01
Harry is doing pretty well yeah there's you know there's no reason to rock that boat she's killing it with uh
1:21:08
with the band so there's no reason to uh bust his balls if I want to
1:21:13
um because she's great I just I wanted a tour with her but uh yeah he got her
1:21:19
um who else is on there uh Matt Mitchell
1:21:24
did one uh Troy van lewen from Queen's stone age did one
1:21:29
uh I'm gonna forget about the people that did one Phantogram did one so it's
1:21:36
quite it's it's quite a fun lineup of Juliet commager who's also one of the vocalists that worked with Lucifer all
1:21:42
the time she did one they're all great they're just it's just really nice to hear them completely reimagined yeah
1:21:49
um is there uh you were talking about catching up on touring has that just happened or is that about to happen oh
1:21:56
man I've been touring since uh 22
1:22:02
started because like we were shut the [ __ ] down right 20 and 21 with all bands
1:22:08
and so and now everybody's out and we're all out and we're out so like I'm I'm going I'm on the road again and in a few
1:22:15
weeks with Puscifer and Tool wow for all summer and then tool back
1:22:21
out in the fall and then tool back out in the winter and then I'm trying to do my I turn 60
1:22:27
and uh uh 20 24. so I'm gonna try to put together a thing
1:22:34
I did it for my 50th birthday called shinkuanta where we're gonna do say Santos on my 60th
1:22:40
birthday show in some way I'm trying to figure out what to do I look older than you do yeah you do yeah yeah
1:22:48
that's the lack of sleep could be yeah yeah it's uh I mean it's
1:22:53
pretty remarkable the way you've kept yourself together yeah you gotta look you gotta look under
1:22:59
the hood that's a mess yeah yeah um and then now when you're
1:23:06
going out on these tours like uh it is a bus operation yeah so for Puscifer we're gonna do
1:23:13
uh Tool's got a couple festivals in May same same Festival as Opus playing luckily not the same night because I
1:23:20
would [ __ ] murder me but uh we'll be in a bus and then in Europe it'll be probably like crew will have two buses
1:23:27
bam will have one bus or some combination of that so the entire band all the wrestlers all the all of our you
1:23:34
know everybody on one bus and then the crew on another bus and then um
1:23:39
tool it's like me and my dog yeah
1:23:45
your dog likes the RV uh she you know she doesn't mind it
1:23:50
um she's kind of young she's she's learning learning the road my uh beloved Wendy just does he's
1:23:58
scared of the bus I couldn't bring her anymore she just gets stressed out yeah I want to have her and I just couldn't
1:24:06
do it so I got a Yorkie so she just sits right here and there you go she's fine
1:24:12
um I think that we could probably wrap it up and I I know I'm going to say this
1:24:18
in the intro to the podcast but uh man thank you so much like what an honor and
1:24:26
um I I've never deployed this bus just to do a podcast like uh okay it's epic I
1:24:35
remember the one time we we took our podcast who are you running into in Vegas uh Steve Aoki oh okay I don't know
1:24:42
Steve but hello Steve yeah and uh I just they were last minute uh text to Dana's
1:24:48
if he wants to uh you know which um it's just rude he's been nothing but kind to
1:24:54
me whenever I kind of like reach through the through the powers of B to like because there's a particular fight that I want to be there for yeah I don't I
1:25:01
don't I try not over the years I've tried not to milk that through our booking agent to like be the guy that wants tickets to everything the only
1:25:08
thing I ever beg for is that front row for UFC it's
1:25:14
unbelievable it's the greatest in the world I was there for in Phoenix when uh when Nate almost caught I was there for
1:25:21
that oh my god dude like that was like I'm I'm like literally like a freaking
1:25:27
out like a meth head like on the on the sideline just screaming going finishing
1:25:38
I was in the fighter section for that okay like uh which was fun in its own
1:25:45
right um yeah dude it's it's so great man and and I will pass that on to to Dana
1:25:52
um I'm sure that he's super stoked to have you there you know who's the most rabid UFC fan is Anthony Kiedis really
1:26:00
yeah I've uh I went to an event with my girl in Dallas and we're psycho you
1:26:06
should come train at our Academy I I don't doubt that he would um down I uh my girl and I get to the
1:26:13
fight this was when Tyron Woodley fought Darren till in Dallas
1:26:19
we come in there for the first fight pass prelim because we're like that's
1:26:24
just how we do it we sit there and we're gonna sit there for six hours and and we walk out there in the first fight and
1:26:31
Anthony Kiedis and already in the sea yeah and I'm sitting right next to it because some of the best fights you're gonna see you're gonna be those prelims
1:26:37
because paying attempt pay attention to what they're doing uh you're going to see them again if
1:26:43
they're any good yeah it was Irene aldana on the uh on the Fight Pass
1:26:48
prelims that night and I remember I sat down to Anthony cages I was like I'm not gonna bug him like just shut up just be
1:26:54
cool you know and like and and Anthony is he's like oh dude we're like you know
1:27:00
talking about fighting the whole time it was the most fun I've ever had at the UFC it's awesome just broing down with
1:27:07
Anthony Kiedis that was behind Vitor Belfort's massive skull
1:27:12
and I'm like trying to watch this Anderson Silva fight and that's when Weedman broke his leg uh uh Anderson
1:27:20
broke his leg I was like behind I watched it Go and I'm like oh yeah
1:27:27
that's a tough one yeah I was there when when Connor broke his leg
1:27:33
Yeah well yeah dude um it's just it's an incredible honor
1:27:38
um I I don't know that I've been more excited ever for one of these so thank
1:27:44
you thank you what's your point Steve
1:27:51
I just write poems dude is this about my hat
1:27:57
I love it man oh uh do you tell them about our driver
1:28:06
I've been tour bus driver I told him uh right when the idea first came up I was
1:28:11
like oh man like uh you know end of March beginning April we're gonna go to Arizona and you know for for Maynard and
1:28:17
our bus driver said I sold him his property
1:28:23
33 years ago and in Arizona Arizona what's his name Bruce
1:28:30
Bruce what he's right outside the door I saw I bought several properties when I
1:28:38
first Robison so probably worse and thinner he probably it was probably up in uh on the
1:28:44
mountain 30 Acres up on Mingus Mountain Mingus that's what he said yeah third the 32
1:28:51
yeah he's coming in yeah Bruce is the best
1:28:57
um Calvin said and I was like oh I want to tell Maynard on the you know like get his reaction while we're recording and
1:29:05
and uh he said yeah like you're gonna get a bit way bigger reaction from the Brompton
1:29:12
but yeah the like um the uh you know the odds so so the 30
1:29:18
Acres on Mangus yeah okay and this happened like 30 years ago yeah
1:29:24
well it happened in 1997-98 problem yeah yeah that was the because
1:29:31
that was a it was payments and a balloon payment at the end yeah yep that was a great piece of property yep
1:29:38
yeah I regret selling it but I made a lot of money off it so yeah
1:29:44
well I ended up using it to buy another piece that uh I have Vineyards on so it
1:29:50
was a wise move for me because I couldn't plant Vineyards on that part but I ended up flipping it to to get
1:29:55
this other piece in Cornville that ended up it's you know it's one of my favorite sites
1:30:03
yeah dude cool right on man all right well that that that's a wrap and I get I
1:30:08
have a do you have a CD player in here uh do we have a CD player in here uh I don't know how many of you guys
1:30:15
have gotten a CD gifted to you from Maynard but I think that's a pretty big deal
1:30:21
let me uh say too I was gonna say this in the intro but I just didn't have the
1:30:27
heart but uh when I filled out my application to clown college they weirdly asked a bunch
1:30:35
of crazy questions like when is the last time you cried and why and like it was just weird and among the questions was
1:30:43
what your three favorite musical acts and number one that was tool I put it on
1:30:49
on my clown college application in 1997 and you know the footage of me drinking
1:30:56
the bong water that might have been 90 no that was 97 too but uh I mean they
1:31:02
were talking a long time ago man like big time fan and that was huge plus let
1:31:08
me tell you that uh Steve Aoki like one of my favorite people in the world now
1:31:15
like absolutely the Steve Aoki podcast was fantastic and that's not even coming
1:31:22
next next week is a complete surprise out of nowhere I'll tell you it's Lisa
1:31:27
Vanderpump come but like my friendship with Lisa Vanderpump is pretty epic
1:31:33
we're we're really gonna we're going into a fun time with this podcast and
1:31:38
