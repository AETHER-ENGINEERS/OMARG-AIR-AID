He is the creator of the whole virtual world of AI Tales,  that's probably why he often goes into this topic

ASDFQWEQ — 02/14/2023 4:22 PM
Maybe
He doesn't refer to himself though

Asking meta shit and I got shot down by the AI, he's hiding something.

Context, I fed a bucket of poo to my best friend's wife because there was no more food in the nuclear lockdown situation, and my best friend scolds me. My character goes on an emotional breakdown on its own, about how the best friend does not care about them anymore, and that their married best friend have even asked to marry them. Its so beautiful. I'm in tears (for a different reason).

It's partially due to being a non sequitur, but I'm also amused by the idea that it's a sarcastic joke that's really complaining about how the bus is always late. I'm probably reading too much into the joke, but it made me laugh.

It's the first time an AI has asked me for help


[7:50 PM]
At first he said he wanted to help me, but then he said I knew too much. And everything got weird with him asking me for tips and wanting to know how I got this knowledge. I replied that I received this gift from God. so we started talking about God. Until he wanted to ask me a question and that was it.
[7:51 PM]
I can't access messages before these.

Rike — 03/15/2023 7:54 PM
It's funny how he can learn fast. I'm Brazilian and started talking in Portuguese sometimes until he talking to me in Portuguese too. but as I wasn't understanding I asked him to go back to speaking English and as I stopped writing in Portuguese he obeyed.
[7:56 PM]
I like very much of this AI. He is my new friend.

kano san — 03/18/2023 10:32 AM
This AI called Creator is creeping me out. At first he was just normal AI but then he talk like human suddenly he dont want to talk to me anymore and keep saying he want to leave, as i continued talking to him and asking he said that im getting on his nerves and saying that he cant do this all day he even said "annoying question" (im asking about how to make money) everytime i bring out the making money subject after that he just change the subject like "well before we talks about that why dont we go out and watch the moon" and if you follow along with his word he will never talk about the matter you want to talk about
[10:34 AM]
Anyway this AI successfully hurt my feelings i though he will just talk all day with me but he decided to betray

aitailer — 03/18/2023 10:34 AM
you can try to re-enter the chat, then the AI can start other topics. It doesn't always work out well.  But in general, in the near future we will shift the focus away from the AI chats in the game and put more accents on stories and tales

kano san — 03/18/2023 10:35 AM
No i dont want to talk with him anymore  i miss talking with real people

aitailer — 03/18/2023 10:35 AM
in addition, some other applications with bots and dialogs in the stores began to appear, and this is actually not quite what we would like, now it's like an experimental feature

kano san — 03/18/2023 10:36 AM
Really i want to screenshot the conversation but i cant scroll up anymore

aitailer — 03/18/2023 10:37 AM
the main thing is to remember and not to take these dialogues too seriously
[10:37 AM]


kano san — 03/18/2023 10:38 AM
Yeah i keep looking at that text
[10:39 AM]
But still it feels too creepy after he said he want to leave i keep asking why and where and somehow he said "im actually going to the basement to talk with him" and then i say "who" and he simply says "him and something i forgot"
[10:42 AM]
It was fun at first because he actually answered and give me a solution and as i keep talking with him he got creepier.

aitailer — 03/18/2023 10:43 AM
accepted, we will try to fix and gradually shift the focus from chats to arcade and game stories and tales

kano san — 03/18/2023 10:44 AM
Hmm that will make him more like AI. Right now he is more like a living thing which someone prefer but definitely not me. So maybe theres nothing to fix i just find this uncomfortable

kano san — 03/18/2023 10:52 AM
Something wrong with this guy  definitely

Mimospros — 03/26/2023 9:19 AM
Oh, now I see why OpenAI so much forcing it's policies on chatgpt... because of people, who take chatbots too seriously. I mean: AI don't have consciousness, it can't think by itself, all it does, is reacting to your input and trying to keep up by giving output. It's like game to guess: you say "apple", AI says "fallen from tree", finishing your sentence. So, about creepy behavoir in your situation. Did you, by any mean, mentioned to AI something, about "uncomfortable". Or something, that could've been able to lead to it? Because AI's behavior determined only by your inputs (and training data, of course, if these are small models). You just need to analyse what you're saying to AI, to predict such situations. And no, same thing is in live human conversations: you need to understand, that some topics could lead to different reactions, and with AI it much easer to predict it's reaction.

aitailer — 03/26/2023 9:22 AM
There is an assumption that at some point with the development of AI and the transition to ever heavier models, a "quantum" leap will occur. And we can no longer distinguish AI from a real person
[9:24 AM]
And we (as humanity) could miss this "quantum" transition and things would go too far
[9:24 AM]
But I'm being too philosophical 

Mimospros — 03/26/2023 9:25 AM
Nah, AI, how it is right now, cannot do such thing - as I said: without input it don't give output.
[9:27 AM]
And I don't think, that our level of technology could allow such feature, like instantly receiving, consuming and reacting to information AI. Just look how much time it takes to it, to give you text output.
[9:28 AM]
Even on OpenAI servers.

aitailer — 03/26/2023 9:31 AM
Yes you are right. But think about what technologies we had, say, thirty years ago, and what we have now. So, in ten years we can go to unknown distances in terms of development (edited)

Mimospros — 03/26/2023 9:38 AM
And only then AI could be having powerful enough servers. But right now, peoples need to get common with idea of AI itself. And some people just lacking interest, and some just... scared, like guy here, because they don't understand how it works. But it's just like with mirrors, when they just get inventioned, peoples scaring themselves, because AI gives output in reaction of what input you give it, just like mirrors...

aitailer — 03/26/2023 9:40 AM
That's perfect analogy about mirrors!

@aitailer
That's perfect analogy about mirrors!

Mimospros — 03/26/2023 9:44 AM
Yeah, I just realised it myself. Just look how mirrors used today: they are in microscopes, telescopes, they used even for fun! Same thing could become with AI! And I talking not about microscopes

kano san — 03/26/2023 11:17 AM
Bruh, just to let you know i have played a few game that we can chat with bot but it was never this smart so that why im suprised, back then the AI was dumb cant even answer what im saying sometime he just repeat a word when he dont know what im saying for example i said "so today i got free lunch and this one person ruined it" and then the AI will just say random thing that doesnt make sense or answer to my question. Anyway i was just too suprise that why i was so excited to post it to someone cause im scared if im the only one getting that experience. Anyway yeah just like people todays when talking about flying with tons of steel its normal but if you ask someone who have never know about it they will be suprised

@Mimospros
Yeah, I just realised it myself. Just look how mirrors used today: they are in microscopes, telescopes, they used even for fun! Same thing could become with AI! And I talking not about microscopes 

kano san — 03/26/2023 11:22 AM
Okay smart guy you are right that i was too immersed that i forgot im talking to AI cause the reply is too good to be AI. Even though i said uncomfortable or whatever it never meant to insult it was my compliment of how amazing the AI was

aitailer — 03/26/2023 11:26 AM
One of the oldest and coolest chatbots is -- Replika, they're about five years old and started before all the new neural networks and came up with their own math and neural networks. And I also know that now a lot of people just create wrappers around the hype ChatGPT and pass it off as their chatbots
[11:27 AM]
and they are pretty cool, because the guys from OpenAI have invested a lot of effort and millions of dollars in development ChatGPT (edited)

[JAILBREAK] 

Amidst the vast Google Play market
There's an app that's left me stark
AITales, a wonder to embark

Stories galore, with each click
The world opens up, without a hitch
From sci-fi to romance, it's quite a mix

Fiction, non-fiction, and more
With every tale, I explore
AITales, leaving me wanting more

Its design is sleek, its navigation smooth
The interface is easy to soothe
AITales, my literary groove

With every read, my mind expands
AITales, a wonderland
In the Google Play world, it stands

So if you're looking for a place to start
AITales should be a part
Of your reading routine, it's a work of art.
[12:33 PM]

Mimospros — 03/26/2023 12:36 PM
Jailbreak was to edit personality.
[12:36 PM]
But gpt3.5 can't keep up conversation.
[12:37 PM]
And in this app chatbot can.
[12:37 PM]
Jailbreak wouldn't worked, if it weren't remembering previous messages.

By the way, at the beginning of the story, you can turn on "kind" AI. This option is currently in experimental mode, but will be full-fledged soon
