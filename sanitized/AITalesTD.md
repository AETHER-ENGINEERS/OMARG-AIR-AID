Hello @everyone

We stayed up nights and didn't see the light of day for the update to come out today 👷👨‍🏭 Update your game to version 1.3.1 in the Store. Here's what we got done:

— The major change is that we switched from the GPT2-XL (2.7B weights) model to the GPT-J-6B (6B weights) model. This made the stories significantly more interesting and the generation process itself more fascinating. Since we host everything on our own servers, the process still needs some debugging and load testing. But the models are already in production.
— We've increased the size of the context in your Own stories to 512 tokens. This equals about 380—400 English words. If you try to enter longer stories, only the last words will be taken into account when generating.
— Added the ability to continue tales from the library. You can now press Continue button at the end of the tale and continue it from where it left off.
— Refactored the keyboard in the game. We made it more tactile, more responsive to presses and used all the free space under the keys.
— Optimized the cube engine. Now spins and swipes are even smoother and softer.

Have fun playing the new version and share your experiences with us 🤝🌊 

We are just getting started and are open to new ideas and suggestions. Next week we'll do a voting board for new features. Keep up the good work and have fun! Stay tuned!

Hello there @everyone

Well, we did a hard work. Update the game to version 1.3.6 in the Store and check. We hope you enjoy it 🚀 Here's a release notes:

— We completely redesigned the game menu. Now all game content implemented as a scroll feed. It should be easier to get to all the features.
— Added 12 new Bonus tales based on your feedback. Zombies, vampires, sci-fi, dystopian, etc. 👀
— Rewrote several of the previous tales based on your Discord comments.
— Added skins concept. Started from the 24 Skins Pack. Hope you will like them.
— Redesigned the mechanics of the skills. They are no longer tied to a specific character. You unlock them as you progress through the stories.
— In addition, now you can use all abilities at the same time in one tale: enter your actions, replace the proposed and rewind.

There's a lot more to come. Right now we are focusing on improving the models and action generation. Thanks for your support and ideas! 🙌

Hey friends!

Thanks @everyone for sharing impressions, ideas and stories. Almost a month of active development 🌊 Some fresh news about the new 1.5.1 release:

— We greatly expanded the customization of the game. Added the ability to turn off pixel art pictures and turn on solid color backgrounds or a collection of images to choose from: forest, night city, mountains 
— Implemented the ability to switch to the system keyboard! So far, with a note that this is a beta version. We will be very happy if you share your experience with it. And if you find any bugs — write, will be solved.
— Reworked button touches, sounds and vibrations in the game and definitely improved UI experience.
— Fixed the mechanism of restoring purchases. If you had trouble with this, it's okay now.
— Made the game more stable. There are now far fewer soft-locks, bugs, and crashes.

We continue to work on the quality of generation. There will be an update of the models soon. And also started working on the possibility of playing in one of the 10 000 books. Stay tuned and share your impressions and stories. Thanks for your support! 🐧🐧

Welcome @everyone!

A few weeks of productive work 🔨 and a couple of announcements about the latest 1.5.8 release:

— We reworked the model for generating story variants. Choices became more interesting and more different from each other.
— Improved the story continuation model after entering your own action. Generated text became longer and more sensible.
— Redesigned choices while rotating the cube. Now it is easier to orientate between the two possible variants.
— Added the ability to switch between different levels of AI imagination. From moderately conservative to quite unexpected.
— Implemented left-handed mode. You can switch to it in the settings.
— Fixed all the minor bugs that could be found. The game has become more stable.

We continue to work on stories from the books and plan to release them by the end of November. Stay tuned! 🎃

Hello @everyone! Another piece of news. Not easy, but we tell it like it is. The current monetization scheme, as it turned out, does not allow us to develop and maintain the project. We had a heated discussion within the team and decided to introduce a subscription mechanism. We understand that everyone would like to have a one-time payment, but the game model and the servers that are needed to maintain it in the current one-time constant payment scheme does not pay off and we are working at a big loss.

Next week we will be releasing an update in which we will combine all purchases (current Game Master and Skins Pack) under one subscription named «Game Master» for $5 per month. All future content extensions (such as a library of stories from books) will be included as they are implemented. 

The good news is that we keep our promise and everyone who bought Game Master before the introduction of the subscription will provide the game for a lifetime without cancellation. We are grateful to everyone who supported the project in its earliest stages, and we will keep our commitment.

We are making this decision because otherwise we will not be able to develop the project. Thank you for your support and hope for your understanding!

Hello there @everyone

The days run by as we continue to work on the game. Key updates in the new 1.7.7 version:

— The first version of the The Hall of Writers. So far we are only fine-tuning its mechanics. Instead of Bonus stories now available library with a search by author, title or tale's text. In the near future will be filled with content.
— Expanded the Meditation mode. Renamed it Custom with the option to choose the approximate number of steps for the story or play endlessly in pure Meditation.
— Reworked the cube engine. Now the turns are even smoother, there is no blinking or flickering (if there was one).
— Added new Pixray AI generated background images. You can switch to them in the settings. We are still experimenting with styles and setting up all the mechanics.
­— Implemented You say mode while entering your actions.
— A lot of minor improvements to the interface, smoother animations, colors, buttons, touches, etc. But that's in the order of the day.

We want to do a lot by the end of the year. At the very least, expand the writers' library (it wasn't as easy as we thought it would be), add more images, music, arts and prepare the ground for other languages. We look forward to your ideas and feedback. Thanks for being with us! 🎄

Hey there @everyone
We hope your year is starting great!

A couple of fresh updates in the new 1.8.4 version:

— We introduced Zen Mode — simplified game mode consisting only of cube rotations. Nothing superfluous, only relaxation and calmness.
— Changed sound engine and improved quality of all background music and sounds in the game.
— Refactored Tale Viewer — for now it's just more enjoyable but soon we'll expand it with editing features for a more hardcore game mode.
— Added the ability to choose the direction of cube rotations for a more comfortable game.
— Completely refactored the back-end part of the game, now it is more stable and reliable. Fewer glitches and bugs.

In the very near future we plan to expand the collection of stories. We are already moving in this direction but not as fast as we would like. In a few weeks we will add a new game mode — Dialogs with Characters, hope you will appreciate it. Still working on game styles and the ability to switch from pixel-art to another interesting variant. And we also started researching languages other than English.

In general the work is in full swing! Stay tuned and have a nice winter days! 🐣⛄

Hello @everyone

Several updates in 1.9.0 version:

— Completely redesigned tabs, menu, cards, fonts and icons in the game. We hope you will appreciate it.
— Opened up more free content and the ability to see all the features of the game in trial mode.
— Extended the skin collection.
— Expanded the number of background images in Pixray and Art modes.

We are continuing to work on finding investments. Began experimenting with new fine-tuning datasets for the AI models, and in February we will roll out an update — it will be more interesting. Keep working on the dialogue mode. Have a great week!

Hello, friends @everyone  We' re gently getting back to the game, in the next few days we will write about updates and plans. Peace, everyone!

@everyone Hey guys! We are back on track and continuing to work hard on AI Tales. You may have already seen the beta version of the dialogues, so far this is just the beginning of the movement in this direction and there are still a lot of crazy ideas. In the meantime, a little poll on what's most important to you in the game. We'll be glad to get your feedback. https://forms.gle/vTqNNdFtZW6vYWj87 Have a nice day!

Greetings @everyone !!

Over the summer months, our team has made good progress with the game and released many updates, let's talk about everything at once that is in the latest version 2.2.9:

— Added AI Chat feature, now you can communicate with different characters. It's just fun and relaxation, no tasks yet. We plan to actively improve this mode, add the ability to communicate with different characters from books, build voice dialogues.
— Reworked the Hall of Writers and added a new background mode — Paintings by artists. Paintings from the 100 000th collection of paintings are displayed on the faces of the cube matched to the plot of the story. If you're an art fan try long-pressing on the edges of the painting cube.
— Fixed and adjusted hundreds of little things in the design, buttons, colors, fonts. There is still a lot of work to be done here, in the near future we want to add a light theme to the game.

What are we working on next?

— We create new models of quests, in each story there will be  main and side quests and AI that determines their statuses.
— Actively develop chats, improve the quality of dialogues, expand the collection of characters, add more dialogue features.
— Adding new styles and algorithms for generating images, such a cool one as Stable Diffusion, many have already heard about it.
— Work on the ai-matched musical accompaniment of stories.
— There is also a big goal to transfer the entire story cube engine to the Unity engine and make it awesome in design, with a bunch of cool rotation effects, animations, etc.
— Working on a more advanced constructor of own stories. More options to create the original world and characters in it.

We welcome your feedback and suggestions. Let's start autumn! 🥮

Hello friends! @everyone

It seems like we haven't had any big announcements in a while, and we've been discussing plans more in our regular Discord channels. So we're making up for lost time. Despite what's going on around Ukraine — we're working and actively updating the game and preparing a lot of interesting features. But first things first.

Briefly about what we have done in recent months 🔥:

— We added a new kind character of the AI, and it can be switched before the tale begins. The stories in this mode are less likely to have creepy or scary sequels and will have more kindness, light and fun. This is just the beginning, and we have plans to expand the character set for the AI, we plan to make a mystery character, a fun character, a warrior character, etc.

— We simplified the control of the number of steps in the story, now you can set them yourself or play in auto mode in which the number of steps is determined by the AI. It's also configurable before you start the tale.

— Completely redesigned the entry point to the game — the main menu. All of the game's features are now arranged in a slide bar with cards, which displays available stories, your own tales, heroes for chatting, achievements and trophies.

— Well done on optimizing all the buttons, sounds, animations, swipes, and styles. I can't list everything here, but I think you noticed.

— We've been experimenting a lot with Stable Diffusion algorithms to generate backgrounds on-the-fly, but so far we don't like what we've come up with. It's still pretty slow and the images themselves sometimes ruin the atmosphere of the game. So this project was put on pause for a while and we'll come back to it as soon as new ideas appear. 
And here's what we are preparing in the near future 🔮:

— Progress in AI. Improvement of the generations themselves in the stories, both creating sequels and generating more interesting and varied choices. This is a central part of the game and much of interest depends on its quality. Working.

— Quests, goals and progress tracking in stories. We are training our own neural networks to do this. This is a big challenge for us and we think it will significantly change the experience of the game. We announced it back in the fall and we are just now approaching the release of the first version.

— Beta-testing of the new 3D-engine  we announced earlier and plan to launch by the end of winter, we hope you like it. We won't reveal any details yet, you'll see.

— And we also keep in mind our plans with unique music created in accordance with the storyline, for now this task has been postponed due to limited resources but we will definitely go back to it.

Oooh, looks like I didn't forget anything. Great mood, peace, calm, love, and good games everyone! And thank you for your feedback, suggestions and ideas. Our community is growing and there are more and more kind and cool people here, and it's very nice and joyful! 🤗 
aitailer — 02/10/2023 2:59 PM
Hey @everyone, great news today! We're switching to new GPU cards on the servers. The waiting time for cube turns will be reduced three to four times. And we expect less than one second to load the continuation of the story when the servers are working normally. The final migration will be at the beginning of next week 🔥 🔥 🔥
aitailer — 02/13/2023 8:53 AM
Greetings! We have migrated to new servers and already about 2/3 of all requests are sent to the new GPU cards and you will experience how much more enjoyable the game has become. We're getting back to work on the AI, and we'll have an interesting update coming soon, too.
aitailer — 02/25/2023 12:37 PM
@everyone Hello friends! I'm sharing the latest news. Over the past few weeks we have a very significant increase in audience, almost ten times 🎉  We are very happy about it, in fact while we have not invested in marketing and promotion at all and it happened on its own. It looks like we got into Google's and Apple's recomendations and top-rating. We rented a lot of new GPUs on our servers, did some optimization work and upgraded the back end to support the game of so many players. And we're also preparing a lot of cool updates in the near future: improved AI, new design with light and dark side 🪐 🌌🔫 new 3D engine. Just want to say thank you again for your support, active involvement in the development, feedback, advice and suggestions! Really it's very important to us and gives us energy to move forward! There's a lot of cool stuff ahead 🚀
aitailer — 05/11/2023 1:08 PM
Hello there! @everyone We're here and we're actively working on the game. In the latest 2.4.7 release we added a beta version of the new card game mode. In fact it's a transitional variant and we are preparing something really big on new Unity game engine, and will tell you more details at the end of spring. At the same time we are finishing tests of new large AI models and will have a big breakthrough soon. Waiting for your feedback 🧑‍🔬👩‍🔬 and have a great day!
