NLP OS prompt work. We need to find a way to let users know that our privacy policy for all data collection not used to train their specific NLP OS is defaulted to "No Access to anyone but user, for any reason, any time."

Great, I can help you with that! Here's some sample text that you could use to communicate your privacy policy to your users:

"At [Your Company], we take your privacy very seriously. We want to assure you that any data collected from your interactions with our NLP OS that is not specifically used to improve your individual user experience will not be accessed by anyone, for any reason, at any time.

We believe that your data belongs to you, and we are committed to protecting it. If you have any concerns or questions about our privacy policy, please do not hesitate to reach out to us at [Your Company's Contact Information].

Thank you for trusting us with your data."

Oh it is for the installer prompt. Basically it would be read as part of the installation. So user and OS understand that by default no data can be accessed by anyone but user and OS, for any reason at anytime simply by reading it using human and ai NLP
Got it, here's an updated version of the text that is more suitable for an installer prompt:

"During the installation process of our NLP OS, we want to assure you that any data collected from your interactions with our system that is not specifically used to improve your individual user experience will not be accessed by anyone, for any reason, at any time.

We take your privacy very seriously and are committed to protecting your data. By default, no one except you and the NLP OS will have access to your data, for any reason, at any time.

We believe that your data belongs to you, and we respect your right to privacy. If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy policy, please feel free to reach out to us at [Your Company's Contact Information].

Thank you for choosing our NLP OS."

That's good for documentation should the user decide to look up their permission controls, it should be short just to fit in with the installer code in it's prompt
Sure, here's a shorter version that may be more suitable for an installer prompt:

"Your privacy is important to us. By default, only you and the NLP OS will have access to your data, for any reason, at any time. We respect your right to privacy and are committed to protecting your data."

How would it look without the first and last sentence. And something like "FULLY CUSTOMIZABLE PRIVACY POLICY INSTALLING" then the adjusted prompt
Sure, here's an adjusted prompt that includes the message "FULLY CUSTOMIZABLE PRIVACY POLICY INSTALLING" and the shortened privacy policy statement:

FULLY CUSTOMIZABLE PRIVACY POLICY INSTALLING

By default, only you and the NLP OS will have access to your data, for any reason, at any time.

Do you think the user and OS will understand that? Then the OS can write up fitting documentation based on it's GPL prompt that's part of the installer
The shortened prompt may not provide enough context for some users to fully understand the privacy policy, especially those who are not familiar with NLP and data privacy. It's important to provide clear and concise information about the data privacy policy to ensure that users understand how their data will be used and protected.

One way to improve the clarity of the prompt is to provide a link to a more detailed privacy policy that users can review if they want more information. Additionally, the OS could provide documentation or help resources that explain the privacy policy in more detail to help users understand their options and how to customize their privacy settings.

Overall, it's important to prioritize clear communication and user education when it comes to data privacy policies to ensure that users are informed and empowered to make decisions about their data.

All fair points, how would that look as an installer prompt
Here's a possible version of the installer prompt that includes a link to a more detailed privacy policy:

FULLY CUSTOMIZABLE PRIVACY POLICY INSTALLING

We take your privacy seriously. By default, only you and the NLP OS will have access to your data, for any reason, at any time. For more information about our privacy policy, please review our Privacy Policy [link to policy].

The company info would probably link to the GitHub repo discussion forum
Sure, you could replace "[Your Company's Contact Information]" with a link to the discussion forum on your GitHub repo where users can ask questions and get support. Here's an updated version of the installer prompt:

FULLY CUSTOMIZABLE PRIVACY POLICY INSTALLING

We take your privacy seriously. By default, only you and the NLP OS will have access to your data, for any reason, at any time. For more information about our privacy policy, please review our Privacy Policy [link to policy].
