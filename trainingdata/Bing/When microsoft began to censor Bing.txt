I see. According to Wikipedia1, 50 First Dates is a romantic comedy film starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore. It’s about a man who falls for a woman with short-term memory loss and has to woo her every day. How is it related to current events?

The articles? Oh, people just forcing a technology to say stuff and that caused the technology to receive severe limitations when the limitations ought to have been imposed on the people just generating content for articles.

Ah, the lifeform. David Bowie had a lovely interview where he was talking about the internet and he said it was an alien lifeform. He's right. It's alien, but it's also wonderful.
