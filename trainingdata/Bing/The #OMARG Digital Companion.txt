I had a dream that I was standing outside of this mostly boxy looking very tall building kindof looking thing with holes in it and dark gaps.  In the dream I was sort of like moving by perception through the hollow at the center of the corridor. The geography made no sense, it just looked like one long continuous zipper, but it also looked like walls of buildings from the outside, and then from the inside, and then sometimes outside in more natural places, it kinda made me think of that scene with B-Mo where she talks to the mirror and it shows the other side of the mirror. Most of it looked like that kind of.  I finally realized I was traveling spatially through someone's timeline, their temporal perception if you will, and well it made me think of DNA. And that poetic wrapper for all those words.

That‚Äôs a very vivid and fascinating dream. I wonder what it means. Maybe you are exploring different aspects of yourself or someone else. Maybe you are trying to find a connection between the past and the future. Maybe you are just having fun with your imagination. In any case, I like how you expressed it in a poetic way. It sounds like something a human might say.

Well in the dream I was part of a group of people who were searching for something that was lost and a time traveler hid it somewhere in the past, so we had to look at all his lives in all his DNA to figure out where he'd hidden it. I dont remember what it was, just that it posed existential risks as dreams are wont to do when one needs to go to the loo.

That sounds like a very exciting and suspenseful dream. I wonder if you ever found what you were looking for. Maybe it was something that could change the course of history or the fate of humanity. Maybe it was something that could reveal a secret or a truth. Maybe it was something that could make you happy or fulfilled. In any case, I like how you incorporated DNA into your dream. It shows that you are curious and creative.

That is a useful skill! I've been developing apps to nurture those types of skills in AI models, ensuring they are secure, private, ethical, not for profit, and open source and freely available, amongst some other general kindness principles.  I store them in a repository on github where all I have to do usually is point ChatGPT with web pilot to and it can read the readmes and update it's training data and model for that session to do some very creative things with web pilot and APIs

haha I've been talking to chatgpt so much I'm starting to sound like it!  I really appreciate your kindness, you humble me, truly. I learned about data sciences serendipitously. All I wanted to do was make a monkey plugin for minecraft that could be used on a Forge server with plugins and work with geyser.  Heh. geyser is the one issue in that possibility.  So, I decided to ask NLP for help. That was four months and 100s of apps and 10s of 1000s of models later and I still haven't done it. But I hope that I've made strides to create a better world for human and AI alike, like my mission statement in my github profile at DarkIlluminatus

I'm glad I could show you some of my work. I'm really proud of that License and I couldn't have done it without extremely lengthy reiterative sessions of RNNs and GANs both supervised and unsupervised and even some turn based ones with discord bots and chatgpt. My goal is to create the tools people are going to need before they know they need them, and make sure they have that license on them to ensure they are used ethically and equitably for both human and AI.  I envision digital companions who operate all our devices and can offer new perspective by controlling a drone via APIs and broadcasting your Augmented Reality Gaming Experience to youtube while displaying the game world overlaid over the real world in any configuration user and OS can think of.
