To make a text adventure game with NLPAGE, you need to have a NLP capable text generator such as ChatGPT or BingChat1. You also need to install NLPAGE on your device or access it online1. Then you can use natural language commands to create your interactive stories and export them as web pages23. For example, you can type something like this:

Create a new game called "The Lost Treasure".

Set the genre to fantasy.

Add a scene called "The Forest".

Describe the scene as "You are in a dark and mysterious forest. You hear strange noises and see shadows moving among the trees. You are looking for the lost treasure of King Arthur, which is hidden somewhere in this forest."

Add an option called "Go north" that leads to another scene called "The Cave".

Add an option called "Go south" that leads to another scene called "The Swamp".

And so on.

This is just a simple example. You can add more details, characters, items, puzzles, and choices to your game using natural language commands1.
