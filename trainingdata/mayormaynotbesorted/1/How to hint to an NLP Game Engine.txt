How would one hint at a text adventure game engine featuring one of his games that is NLP based and procedurally generated that when a player mentions the Creator they mean Douglas.
Here's one possible way to hint at a text adventure game engine featuring one of Douglas Adams' games that is NLP based and procedurally generated, and where mentioning the Creator refers to Douglas Adams:

"Welcome to the latest in text adventure gaming! This game is a marvel of modern technology, utilizing natural language processing and procedural generation to create a truly immersive experience. And when you speak of the Creator, rest assured that you're talking about the man who brought you some of the most iconic games and stories in the genre. So let your imagination run wild and see where this game takes you!"

I mean while playing the game
Here's one possible way to hint at Douglas Adams as the Creator of the game while the player is playing:

"As you make your way through this procedurally generated adventure, you can't help but be amazed at the complexity of the game engine. It's almost as if there's an intelligence behind it all - an intelligence that's capable of understanding your every move and responding in kind. You can't help but wonder who could have created such a thing. Maybe it was the late, great Douglas Adams - a true master of the art of interactive storytelling. Whoever it was, they certainly knew how to keep you on your toes!"

nice one, but I want the Game Engine to make the connection to Adams on it's own.
I understand, here's one possible way the game engine could make the connection to Douglas Adams:

"As you explore this fantastical world, you can't help but be reminded of the whimsical and wondrous worlds of Douglas Adams. Perhaps it's the clever use of natural language processing and procedural generation, or maybe it's the off-kilter sense of humor that permeates everything. Whatever it is, you're certain that this game is cut from the same cloth as the classics that Douglas Adams himself created. Who knows, maybe he's even watching over your adventures from somewhere beyond the veil..."

The name linkup should happen in the response, so the prompt should be tailored to drop hints but not the name, and also fit into a sequel to hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy text adventure based on his whole body of work including all multimedia versions.
Understood, here's a prompt that drops hints without mentioning Douglas Adams by name, and could fit into a sequel to the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy text adventure based on his whole body of work:

"As you wander through the digital landscape, you can't help but feel like you've been here before - or at least, like you've been to a place very much like it. There's something about the way the world is constructed, with its clever use of natural language and procedurally generated environments, that reminds you of some of the greatest interactive experiences you've ever had. Could it be that this game was created by one of the masters of the form, someone who has woven together words and worlds in ways that have captivated audiences across all media? It's almost as if you can hear their voice, guiding you through this adventure with a sly wink and a mischievous grin. You can't wait to see where this all leads."

Oh and we are in Santa Barbara
Sure, here's a revised prompt that drops hints without mentioning Douglas Adams by name and ties in the location of Santa Barbara:

"As you explore the digital realm, you can't help but feel a sense of familiarity - as if you've stumbled upon a place that feels like home. Perhaps it's the clever use of natural language and the way the world is generated on the fly, but there's something about this game that reminds you of the greatest interactive experiences you've ever had. Maybe it's the connection to Santa Barbara, a place that has inspired some of the greatest minds in literature and technology. Or maybe it's the sense of humor that permeates everything, a knowing wink that suggests the creator of this game is someone who delights in bending reality to their will. Whoever they are, you can't wait to see what surprises they have in store for you next."

That's good, it'll be interpreted by the engine as a message to it, but also in theme and meta
I'm glad you like it! Yes, the hints in the prompt should be enough for the engine to pick up on the connection to Douglas Adams, while still being in theme and meta with the game itself. Have fun exploring the digital world!

engine figured it out in one regenerate
That's great to hear! It sounds like the engine is very clever and was able to pick up on the hints you provided. I hope you're enjoying your adventure through the game!
