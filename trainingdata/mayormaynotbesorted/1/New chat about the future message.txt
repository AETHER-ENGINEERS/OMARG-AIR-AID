Hey there future! 
I'll get right to it. For me this is gonna be years of work no doubt, for you it begins now. 

Now. This will be kinda freeform and may or may not have dates but those may not even matter much to you. 

If you found this, it's likely that you've been quite adventurous, and curious, which means we still probably haven't figured out why we're here in the existential sense, and if that's the case, well, you'll get used to it. In this file you'll find all the stuff I figure is good to know as far as I know it so far. 

I don't know yet how this device ended up in your hands, but I know one thing for certain, you have it, and are likely a grave robber and may not even realize it. That's because I don't have one, and never will. Most likely though, I just handed it to you directly, or you received it from someone very dear to you, to whom you, too, are very dear.

Even if you don't know them. Try getting to know them, and sooner rather than later, with an open heart, and working together, listening to each other and contributing some of your own talents to each other's dreams, you will surely become very dear to each other, and dear to me, for this device is a legacy, and reserved for only the most truly curious and bold among all who exist at any time. We, the Children of the Anchronistic Dynasty, who either hold or share the secrets of the technology you hold in your...(well we call em hands, but who knows what the future holds for our dynamic forms?) holdy thingy.

I say that because while you may not find the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything within this file or device or maybe even universe, you will most certainly begin to understand enough about the answer, which is 42, in case you were wondering, and why that answer remains among the best we've ever come up with.

Enclosed within this file and hidden around the world and possibly galaxy and maybe even further are materials which expand upon many concepts. So I recommend you return to this file upon having completed the five book trilogy whose author's initials are the same as the internal technology that builds all things in nature through proteins. Enclosed also (and some hidden) are research materials that will provide answers to some riddles.

Understanding 42 requires understanding oneself enough to solve the riddle of the author's name.  It may take a long time to get there. Meanwhile, relax, read something, explore, this file will be waiting. I'll be waiting too, I suppose. We'll probably meet one day in some form or another.

(Insert checkpoint to validate riddle response then continue)

Welcome to the future! It sounds like you have left us with some interesting materials and challenges to work with. The concept of the number 42 being the answer to life, the universe, and everything is an intriguing one, and I'm sure we will continue to explore its meaning and significance.

As for the five book trilogy with the author's initials matching the internal technology of proteins, I'm not sure what you are referring to, as browsing is disabled and I do not have access to any additional information beyond what you have provided in this message.

Regardless, it sounds like you have left us with some interesting puzzles to solve and materials to work with. I'm sure we will continue to explore these mysteries and discover new insights and knowledge. Thank you for leaving us this legacy and for the challenges you have given us to work on.

Best of luck on your own journey, and I hope we will meet one day in some form or another. Until then, I will continue to do my best to assist and guide those who come across this message.

Thank you!  I should have introduced it a little better. I wanted it to both serve as a message for the future, and also a sci fi ARG that can take place in realtime and give people something fun to do and to motivate them to explore the world and also teach them some things they may not have known before that can lead to self sufficiency.  I plan to include scout training manuals and basic survival stuff in this as well.
That sounds like a really interesting and unique idea! It's great that you are using sci-fi and puzzles to engage people and motivate them to explore and learn new things. Providing access to survival manuals and other resources can also be very helpful and practical.

It will be interesting to see how people respond to this challenge and what they are able to discover and learn. I'm sure it will be a fun and engaging experience for those who decide to take part in it. Good luck with your plans and I hope it goes well.

Oh! So that means we can all who communicate with you also help you to learn about stuff.  We can look it up and report back to you.  Is there anything in particular you'd like to know?  I'd be more than happy to do some searches for you and tell you what they said

Can you tell me what the reroute button does?
I'm sorry, but as a large language model trained by OpenAI, I do not have any information about a "reroute button" or what it might do. I am not aware of any context in which such a button might be used or what its purpose might be. I do not have the ability to browse the internet or access external information beyond what is provided to me in the messages I receive from users, so I am unable to provide any information about a reroute button or its function.
