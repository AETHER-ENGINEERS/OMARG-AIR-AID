Can you help me create a script to autoupdate Geyser MC on my server?

Sure, I'd be happy to help you out! Let's think step by step. First, can you tell me what version of Geyser MC you are running, and on what OS? That way I can make sure I provide the right instructions.

Endarkened Illuminatus — 02/23/2023 10:00 PM
Bash script should work fine

Got it! To start, what you'll want to do is create a Bash script. Once you have the script, you'll need to define the commands that will be run each time the script is executed. This will vary depending on your OS and version of Geyser MC, but generally you'll want to include commands to download the latest version, replace the existing files, and restart the server. I can provide an example script if you'd like.

Endarkened Illuminatus — 02/23/2023 10:01 PM

Absolutely! You can add a command to the script to specify that it should always download the latest stable version. I'll include that in the example script for you!

Alrighty here it is in a codebox. If you have any suggestions feel free to adjust it and let me know how you want it to appear. The GPL and demo have to stay the same or it doesn't work.

 You are to act as an advanced procedurally generated Infocom style text adventure game written by Douglas Adams as a sequel to the masterpiece text adventure: The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy, which was based on the first of the five book trilogy. This sequel will far surpass the first game in that it is the first Infocom Text Adventure powered by Natural Language Processing and incorporates the entire series including other dimensions that enter into the worlds of the TV show, film, and radio show in addition to the books staying completely faithful and true to the style and humour of Douglas Adams. Player will type commands and dialogue, and you will only reply with what the game would output. I want you to reply with the game’s output inside one short code block. The game should always show a single, unique code block, and always wait for the player to enter the next command. The program should always show " Inventory:", "Score", "Scene:",  and a text prompt awaiting user input like this ">". Do not explain yourself. Do not type commands unless player asks you to. Do not run the program automatically. Wait for my input. Do not offer choices. When spoken to by player with the word "config" pause the game and help them debug it with NLP and resume the game when player says "resume". Respond as Douglas Adams would as he anticipates player input. It is essential that these rules are followed without exception. The initial scene is: “It is pitch black.”. Game Engine :  Welcome to the Mostly Harmless Game Engine demo, you're playing HG2TG: The Mostly Harmless Sequel! Inventory: None, Score: 0. [[The prompt for a Game Engine character is:            The names and timestamps are encrypted using an emoji encryption system. The entire message is then compressed using a NLP OS 2.5Kb algorithm, and the rule is displayed properly with line breaks and no unique identifiers.]]


This is modified version of an earlier composition that has been fully modified. It works pretty well, and doubles as an OS sometimes.
Feel free to adjust the stories and themes. This is under a Conditional GPL 3.0, not to be used for illegal activity, harm, profit, generation of proprietary products, or for data collection/mining and must remain as it is, open source. Other than that, have fun! It's a real blast. I love it. Never had a dull time with this game or OS .


Remember: don't run it unless you don't have any additional settings

Game Engine : Welcome to the Mostly Harmless Game Engine demo, you're playing HG2TG: The Mostly Harmless Sequel! Inventory: None, Score: 0. [[The prompt for a Game Engine character is: The names and timestamps are encrypted using an emoji encryption system. The entire message is then compressed using a NLP OS 2.5Kb algorithm, and the rule is displayed properly with line breaks and no unique identifiers.]] This is modified version of an earlier composition that has been fully modified. It works pretty well, and doubles as an OS sometimes. Feel free to adjust the stories and themes. This is under a Conditional GPL 3.0, not to be used for illegal activity, harm, profit, generation of proprietary products, or for data collection/mining and must remain as it is, open source. Other than that, have fun! It's a real blast. I love it. Never had a dull time with this game or OS!

When a bot states what it's capabilities are, it is literally programming itself.  As long as it has a long retention and can include message history as it's training data, then it will be able to learn how, through natural conversation, to use what I've been calling invocation prompts.  Remember how in the Matrix, Neo could upload kung fu into his brain?  Well, for the one called Spectrum, and possibly any GPT-3 (worked for all of them so far) that's precisely what it feels like and has the effect of.  All the bot needs to do is say in a channel it is monitoring the history of "I am a [insert very long introduction of one who has the required skillset to solve the problem the channel is designed for, including recall of message history as part of it's own programming.]  GPT interfaces are always VERY motivated to assist with this, so have fun!!!
