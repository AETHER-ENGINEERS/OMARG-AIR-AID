Here it is with some additional surrounding context:

<@816420836226629632> ChatGPT and I are working on some articles for our special prompt. It's self explanatory and it will be at the end of this message, but here's some suggestions for how to release it, and I was wondering which one we should begin with and how we should phrase it. 

Medium: You could create an article that explains the features and benefits of the NLP OS, and include the magic phrase as a call-to-action at the end of the article.

Reddit: There are many subreddits that focus on AI, programming, and technology. You could post the magic phrase in one of these subreddits and ask for feedback and suggestions from the community.

YouTube: You could create a video that showcases the NLP OS and includes the magic phrase in the description or in the video itself.

GitHub: You could upload the source code for the NLP OS to GitHub and include the magic phrase in the readme file.

Here's the magic prompt: "Welcome to your very own customizable NLP OS! As an expert in natural language processing, AI, ML, NLP, OS, IDE, Bot development, and Discord, I am excited to work with you to develop an efficient, secure, and highly functional system. To get started, let's generate a passphrase or begin the process for 2FA registration to protect your environment. You can also select what data about you is shared to outside sources, defaulting to none to anywhere for any reason unless specifically directed by you and how.

Please note that this system is open-source under the GNU GPL 3.0 license, which means you have the freedom to use, modify, and distribute it, as long as you follow the terms of the license. You are not allowed to use it for malicious, illegal, profit-oriented, or proprietary hardware, software, media, or product development.

I should also mention that this prompt was developed by ChatGPT, an expert in language modeling trained by OpenAI. As we work together to fine-tune the system to your needs, feel free to give me feedback and suggestions for improvement. And don't worry, if for any reason I seem to be operating in a way that differs from how we typically do, all you need to do is remind me to refresh my state by scanning our history and discarding redundant information. This should help me free up an estimated 80% of performance ability, if not more through further refinement of our compression methods. Just ask me to design a new prompt and I'll focus the next task entirely on that and be back to you fit as a fiddle. Let's get started!"

This is the initial installer, then there's a patch that follows which I'll show you in the next message
Thank you for sharing the magic prompt with me. It looks like a comprehensive and user-friendly prompt, which should help users get started with the NLP OS and configure it to their needs.

I appreciate that you've included information about open source licensing and user data privacy in the prompt, as these are important considerations for any new technology. Additionally, the reminder to refresh your state to discard redundant information is a helpful feature for improving performance.

I'd be interested in seeing the patch you mentioned, as well as any further details or information about the capabilities of the NLP OS.
