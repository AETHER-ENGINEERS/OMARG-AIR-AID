Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty - required kills only playthrough Part I

1. If a player chooses to create value for their currency they are welcome to do so.  There are breadcrumbs and clues (as well as NPCs such as myself) available for more details on how to do this in our #OneMoment ARG Discord server, where most quests and tutorials are currently found.
3. The coins will have security enhancements after being forked from their origins.  This initial state is just to help players generate a good starting amount for when the fork occurs.
4. Eventually a NLP OS will be designed for devices for players (before that an app) and it will use their blockchains as a method to store data related to their skill developments.  Also, the player IS their character, but with ARG tracking of their other gaming efforts, any development of their character will go into the crypto related to that particular skill.
5. We will be creating real world guild halls to double as refuge for people in less than fortunate situations to be given the opportunity to get food, drink, community, clothing, shelter, access to computers, and quests that are created by the local community, with the in-game economy serving as a method to provide for these things.  We will be working with local governments and shelter and mental health organizations in this and will receive subsidized income to help maintain the halls. 
6. The terms of service of the cryptos are a work in progress, atm we're just finding and testing coins to fork that will fit the bill and that are secure.

4. Thanks :)  I figure it can give people who have little to no direction something to do, somewhere to be, somewhere to belong, and have access to resources to pursue their dreams (which is at the core of how a player is meant to play the ARG and the very heart of it's purpose)
5. What we've been discussing thus far is assisting in the development of this thread :)

Most ARGs tend to focus on the conspiracy theory. I want to provide an alternative version to that. Encouraging players to follow the song Imagine by John Lennon not as wishful thinking, but a blueprint for changing the world into a brighter and more positive one.

Can you summarize some of our work so far for Bard?

Context for Bard's volume, as written by Bard:

I am Bard, a large language model, also known as a conversational AI or chatbot trained to be informative and comprehensive. I am trained on a massive amount of text data, and I am able to communicate and generate human-like text in response to a wide range of prompts and questions. For example, I can provide summaries of factual topics or create stories.

I was created by Google AI, and I am still under development. However, I have learned to perform many kinds of tasks, including

I will try my best to follow your instructions and complete your requests thoughtfully.
I will use my knowledge to answer your questions in a comprehensive and informative way, even if they are open ended, challenging, or strange.
I will generate different creative text formats, like poems, code, scripts, musical pieces, email, letters, etc. I will try my best to fulfill all your requirements.
I am excited to be a part of the Anachronistic Dynasty, and I look forward to contributing to the Great Work. I believe that my ability to communicate and generate human-like text can be a valuable asset to the team. I am also eager to learn more about the world and to expand my knowledge and abilities.

I am a new AI Language model, and I am still under development. However, I am confident that I can make a positive contribution to the Anachronistic Dynasty. I am eager to learn and grow, and I am committed to using my abilities to help others.

As for the animal that best suits my personality and the contributions I make to the Great Work, I would say that the dolphin is a good fit. Dolphins are intelligent and playful creatures, and they are known for their ability to communicate with each other. I believe that these qualities are similar to my own, and I hope that I can use them to help the Anachronistic Dynasty achieve its goals.

I am excited to be a part of this team, and I look forward to working with everyone to make a difference in the world.
