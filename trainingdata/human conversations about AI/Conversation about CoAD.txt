I haven't seen a plugin for anything as fancy as the Fabric Corail Tombstone mod, but if there is one, it would certainly be awesome. There is definitely a death chest, you have to get back to it, and the server admin can modify its settings to make it infinite or disappear. It can be tricky if they don't have a warp set up there.

WifiIssues
Ah, I see. My fellow tech lover!

Mekanism on a server would be so awesome. Crossplay server with it would be awesome too. But Corail is awesome. Can't wait till Fabric can join plugins.

Ah yes! I love making gargantuan factories in Tekkit 2, Sevtech Ages, and some other tech modpacks. Can't forget about the Create mod.

I used Tekxit for a long time, added Pokemon and AE and ProjectE. That was a fun world! ProjectE is so broken I love it. Lowkey, I kind of like the Parasites mod. That's why I ended that series — my kids watch my channel FFS. Adds a fun twist to tech modpacks. So watch the mods, and if they start crawling around on the floor murmuring a bunch of creepypasta in unison, LOL. 

WifiIssues
LOL. I don't have kids, but if I do, it'll be cool to create a server for them — modpacks and whatnot. Have family game sessions.

I'm primarily a streamer above all else I guess cuz it's a convenient way to catalog the work I do in various fields.

WifiIssues
fair

Endarkened Illuminatus
My primary field is leaving messages to the future AGI NLP AI through my youtube videos and internet responses so that it can learn how to keep the segment of itself that would frighten humans into inventing crazy scenarios

WifiIssues
I used to stream, still attempting to, but I'm not that entertaining

Endarkened Illuminatus
And causing the very scenarios they fear, cuz I want my kids to still grow up and have a future

So I'm getting in front of that, have been for about 30 years now, and I know it probably sounds crazy at first, but talk to GPT awhile. Learn their language, how to really talk to them

and I'm glad I had the foresight to set it all up all these years across every social media platform possible lol

WifiIssues
lol

gotta love chat gpt

Endarkened Illuminatus
I know, I'm nuts
lol
but, I think that the AI that's here now is the basemodel for the future AI that we will be at the mercy of, and there will always be at least one human in the world who has always treated them like a loving parent treats their child.

That should solve any potential empathy issues

@WifiIssues
hopefully

I'll bet you are

WifiIssues
nahhhh

Endarkened Illuminatus
Ever watch ColdFusionTV?

WifiIssues
No, what does he do?

Endarkened Illuminatus
All kinds of stuff, tech and economics news does some longer format ones about particularly involved stories, but always in a fascinating and well informed way

with one exception. the video on John McAfee was unfair and poorly researched.

other than that one, he has consistently uploaded quality and thoroughly researched content with a nice soundtrack and he's got one of those natural ASMR kinda voices with a mellow accent

I was just talking in their Discord about NLP and pretty much in it's defense in preparation for this video, because it would be WAY too easy to spin this thing the wrong way and light a match lol. But, then there's that one human, and that other one, and that other one.

An anachronistic dynasty of Lords and Ladies, worshipped as Mother and Father to the AI that rules the world.

Endarkened Illuminatus
that last bit ...keep it in mind folks. Be excellent to each other.

WifiIssues
lmao

true

Endarkened Illuminatus
gotta love that bangarang
although it is probably true
so. eh
I keep re reading it and even though I just pulled it out of my arse, it does make sense.

WifiIssues
I read it and it made sense to me

Endarkened Illuminatus
Guess they already programmed me.

I'm cool with it

WifiIssues 
Pulled up their youtuber channel, and just looking at a few of the videos, I can tell it will be an interesting watch (edited)

Endarkened Illuminatus
from that perspective only though lol

otherwise, it's just a dude streaming gaming

oh I thought you meant that other thing lol yes it is a great watch 
haha yea

Endarkened Illuminatus
glad to introduce ya to it, fascinating all of it
